When I feel cold
I'll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home
And when at night
Your toes touch mine
I'll sing you to sleep
If you were mine to keep
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
To sway just like
It was Friday night
And all the lights
Will blind me dry
My lullaby
Is your sigh
And I can feel it
When you cry
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
I wish I could leave you my love
But my heart is a mess
My days they begin with your name
And nights end with your breath
With your breath
When I feel cold
I'll keep you close
And if I could hold you
And take you home
And if I could hold you
And take you home
Yeah you seem to be okay
Your sweet taste is my mouth stays
So I'll be waiting in the corner
For you
Mind less, I'm just spineless
Put Cellophane on my mouth and kiss
Love is lying in the corner
For you, you
It's true, true
Grow old with these folds of time
Mould each other into perfect wine
Bless the day that our heartbeats lined
Love is lying in the corner
For you, you.
It's true, true
For you, you
It's true, true
I sing this broken tune
Is it for you
As we see we're growing older
I'll wait here for you
You wait for the truth
Everyday is getting longer
Yeah I know that it's no secret
With intensity, we split sticks
Slowly dying in the corner
With you, you
It's true, true
With you, you
It's true, true
With you, you
It's true, true
5 A.M. trains
And broken chains
I called you every afternoon
Forest Gump
And the hurricane trails
Though we never followed through
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn't even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer, to you
A lover's home
Is never shown
It's never known, to the common folk
You called me over
Said my name three times over
But you never looked me in the eyes
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn't even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer, to you
Do you have a 100 words for me?
'Cause I have only three
And you couldn't even sing for me
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And I keep getting closer, to you
And I keep on writing these songs
Over and over
As I keep getting older with you
I could never speak in tunes before
But for you I could write a symphony
If only you would sing along
Doesn’t even need to be in key
Is what I have enough for you?
Or do you need all the things that I don’t.
Separate all the lies from the truths
Picking up the pieces so
Can we hide, I need you close
Can we pause this moment, keep it open
Close dance alone
And in time we’ll split our
Hearts wide open.
Yes everything it changes
But we still feel the sameness
Slip away, as we fade away
Can you make me feel
That you will never leave
Will it ever be the same again?
We hold each other, just to stay in place
Maybe I’ll just be the one to say
Can we hide, I need you close
Can we pause this moment, keep it open
Close dance alone
And in time we’ll split our
Hearts wide open
Love, hold me close
Can we pause this moment, keep it open
No, can we go home?
And this time we’ll keep our
Hearts wide open
And I have been fighting for you
Open wounds and loose smiles, for you
I could have been another friend
Or I could pretend
Could you open your doors?
Can we climb out your windows?
Or would you fall with me love?
When you find me within you
It's red as wine, I'll shine, you'll see
It's open and close
I'm fine, believe me
These cold and empty skies, you'll see
My fingers will hold your hand, believe me
I have been fighting for you
Open wounds and loose smiles, for you
I could have been another friend
Or I could pretend
Could you open your doors?
Can we climb out your windows?
Or would you fall with me love?
When you find me within you
Could you open your doors?
Can we climb out your windows?
Or would you fall with me love?
When you find me
Don't worry about me
I have got another hour so to kill
Don't worry about me
I'll find another place to begin
It's so redundant
Have faith, have patience my life
To know we trip the rest is yet to come
Oh it's time
Oh love be mine
Oh oh go slow
So high, so low
Don't worry about me
I've faith in another trip of revery
Don't worry about me
I've got a million fix up my sleeves
You'll never know
How near, how far, and it goes
So don't you fret
My dear by now you should know
Oh it's time
Oh love be mine
Behold desires
Oh love be mine
Behold desires there is a fire that burns
Inside my soul cause
We crossed our desires, we crossed our eyes
In tokens, in charms, in smoke, in kind
We spent it all
We buried our cause
We straightened our spine
Swayed and fettered, swooned and crowned
Even the bliss is pain somehow
I read up on glances and tethered to chances
Eloped with the sounds
How did you perceive me
And how did you complete me
Cold shoulders apart
Sway into my arms
Slip into my heart
I stumbled with grace in my stride
I cordoned my hopes to one side
I slipped on my swerves
I balanced on curves
I slowed down my ride
Oh when you were faded, you looked away
When you were spoken, when you refrained
I called in my favours
I called in my troops
I left you
And all of my heart is broken but the salt of my wounds
Will never follow you around, I won't ever make a sound
And taking every step in fear, if only you could hold me close
This time I think I'm bound to stay alone
And last night was the first time, we inched close to cyanide
Our blood red as beetroots, and I can show you
The skies they felt orange, they held me in solace
Just whisper my name, I'll never let you go
Baby, can you hold me close, please
And tell me all your stories, so I can sleep in peace?
Baby, can you whisper my name?
I could never swim in sorrows, but tomorrow always follows
So, I'll tie up my lips for you, babe
Silently we break our keys, see
Can we open doors?
Shyly find me, wind me, kindly
Kiss me as I drown
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown
And if only your love could hold me
If your arms would just enfold me
I would tie up my lungs for you, babe
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown
As I drown, as I drown, as I drown, as I drown
Babe, did you take my heart?
Babe, did you take my heart?
But we fell apart
Take me back to the start
But we fell apart
Take me back to the start
Babe, this is all there is left
And your touch, was all that was left
But we fell apart
Take me back to the start
But we fell apart
Take me back to the start
When you took my heart
And you took my heart
When you took my heart
And you took my heart
And you took my heart
We didn't lie together
With our tired limbs and bones
In exile together
Find a way to come back home
I did pause, I did stay
I did fall, I did care
And so I beg you
And so I beg you
For your time
And you hold my silence in your truth
And you hold my silence in your truth
Every vacant hour
Every empty broken rule
Could grow old desire
In your full sleeves and my torn shoes
I was young, I was taken
And in time, forsaken
And so I beg you
To be mine
Mine
To be mine
Don't leave me hanging sideways
We are drunk and driving highways
And our bodies are inclined
To escape the morning light you
Bring your hopes up with the sunrise
But our hearts lie someplace else
We are hidden behind these window sills
We are hidden behind these sheets that never end
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
I did try to be your lover
It was beautiful under covers
And our bodies were inclined
We are wasted in our youth and
We are spent and we are clueless
Did we question our souls?
We are hidden behind these window sills
We are hidden behind these sheets that never end
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
If you go, I won't even know now
If you leave, I won't even show it now
I won't even frown
Cold feet were a trademark with you
And all the old games we played
And all the flames that did fade
Truth be told, all our dreams are sold
And all the foul play we hate
And all the flames that did fade
So true to my game
I did hope it would change
For my pride is you
My only find is you
And all my time is you
Before i try to bleed
Before my soul does sleep
I'm overwhelmed with you
My only find is you
And all my time is you
My only find is you
And all my time is you
So true to my game
I did hope it would change
For my pride is you
My only find is you
And all my time is you
For my pride is you
My only find is you
And all my time is you
When I was young I could tell between the moon and the stars
And I would hlod my breath underwater for a minute and a half
You came along, to be my baby
And then you came along, to be my darling
Love, when did I learn to be perfectly fine, with the
Wind in my hair and the cold of my feet was gone
Then you came along to be my baby
Love, then you came along, to be my darling
It was love before I even held your hand
It was love and I could tell that I was weak
In the knees and so we danced our time away, into the night
I thought I was, born in a jungle but I was born
In a palace of green and I couldn't stay
Another night without holding my knees between yours
Another night without feeling your lips on mine
Baby if they, call me a failure you could be my prize
If my life is a joke, you could be my smile
Another home, another land, another city
If it means that I could be a better man in your eyes
It was love before I even held your hand
It was love and I could tell that I was weak
In the knees and so we danced our time away, into the night
It was love before I even held your hand
It was love and I could tell that I was weak
In the knees and so we danced our time away, into the night
It was love before I even closed my eyes
It was love and I could tell that you were
Holding your breath
And so we sang our hearts, out into the night, out into the night
Out into the night
I'm glaring wildly at traces of love
Staring blankly at signs from above
Breathe under the sun, living without kin or kith
We are all looking for someone to be at ease with
And wined and dined, a trollop at nine
Believe it or not, she's doing fine
Often, everything we know turns out a myth
We are all looking for someone to be at ease with
Ease, to be at ease
To be at ease
To be at ease
To be at ease with
A drop of luck, a pinch of fate
Lift your heart, it's never too late
Sow your blood, reap your flesh, hold steady your scythe
We are all looking for someone to be at ease
And we are all looking for someone to be at peace
To be at peace
She thinks of herself as an artist
She walks to the show like a queen
Her demeanour is slick
And she can turn you down with a flick
Of her fingers if she feels it
She thinks of herself as a lady
She walks down the aisle with grace
And her hair falls down her neck
And she might even give you a peck
On the lips if she feels it
She thinks of herself as an artist
Oh she is an artist
It was shown and behold her hair was golden
Her eyes were blue, as the sea was bold and free
Her eyes were bold and free
We grew with the town, we laughed and we frowned
Our eyes withdrawn, but our hearts were bold and free
Our hearts were bold and free
We walked with our shadows behind us and close
We danced with our bodies with me holding on to you
And you holding on to me
We painted the sky, with blues of a thousand kinds
We were fools, for the moon was ahead all this while
The moon was ahead all the time
So broken and done, our souls and our bones
May be old and sore, but our eyes they shone like the sun
Our eyes they shone like the sun
We walked with our shadows behind us and close
We danced with our bodies with me holding on to you
And you holding on to me
With me holding on to you
And you holding on to me
I hold my breath and
Slow my heartbeat when
You console me
Babe you showed me the light
When I'm lonely
When I'm over the edge
Babe you fool me
Babe you showed me the light
I've held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I've held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I pride myself in
Knowing you so well
But you know me
Baby you show me the light
In my heartache
In my lonesome time
Babe you found me
Babe you showed me the light
I've held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I've held you tight
Could not open my eyes
So lets start over
Pour my heart out to you
Oh I am clueless
Babe you showed me the light
So we'll saunter
To a thousand suns
We'll just wonder
Babe you showed me the light
I've held you tight
Could not open my eyes
I've held you tight
Could not open my eyes
Oh, would you call me a liar
If I told you my love, had no end
Oh, would you call me a liar
If I told you my love, had no beginning
No one was hiding
What we were trying to find
Was always there
We were just not aware
We were folding our jeans
To step into the salty sea
Let the sand stick to our toes
Until we fall asleep
Oh, would you call me a liar
Oh, can you hold my fire, for me
Oh, can you hold my fire
So, Why did you take my heart away,
This love, just winter ahead.
And even the chain couldn't keep but still,
This love, maybe it will.
This night will swallow our sin's,
What i wouldn't do just to be with you,
