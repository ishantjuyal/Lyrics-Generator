tendency of gettin\\' stuck\\r\\nOn backroads at night\\r\\nAnd I was right there beside him all summer long\\r\\nAnd then the time we woke up to find that summer gone\\r\\nBut when you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think my favorite song\\r\\nThe one we danced to all night long\\r\\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\\r\\nWhen you think happiness\\r\\nI hope you think that little black dress\\r\\nThink of my head on your chest\\r\\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think of me\\r\\nSeptember saw a month of tears\\r\\nAnd thankin\\' God that you weren\\'t here\\r\\nTo see me like that\\r\\nBut in a box beneath my bed\\r\\nIs a letter that you never read\\r\\nFrom three summers back\\r\\nIt\\'s hard not to find it all a little bittersweet\\r\\nAnd lookin\\' back on all of that, it\\'s nice to believe\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think my favorite song\\r\\nThe one we danced to all night long\\r\\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\\r\\nWhen you think happiness\\r\\nI hope you think that little black dress\\r\\nThink of my head on your chest\\r\\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think of me\\r\\nAnd I\\'m back for the first time since then\\r\\nI\\'m standin\\' on your street\\r\\nAnd there\\'s a letter left on your doorstep\\r\\nAnd the first thing that you\\'ll read is:\\r\\n\"When you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think my favorite song\\r\\nSomeday you\\'ll turn your radio on\\r\\nI hope it takes you back to that place\"\\r\\nWhen you

the way\\r\\nI hate that stupid old pickup truck\\r\\nYou never let me drive\\r\\nYou\\'re a redneck heartbreak\\r\\nWho\\'s really bad at lying\\r\\nSo watch me strike a match\\r\\nOn all my wasted time\\r\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned you\\'re\\r\\nJust another picture to burn\\r\\nThere\\'s no time for tears\\r\\nI\\'m just sitting here planning my revenge\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing stopping me\\r\\nFrom going out with all of your best friends\\r\\nAnd if you come around saying sorry to me\\r\\nMy daddy\\'s gonna show you how sorry you\\'ll be\\r\\nI hate that stupid old pickup

talks about\\r\\nAnd she\\'s got everything that I have to live without\\r\\nDrew talks to me\\r\\nI laugh \\'cause it\\'s so damn funny\\r\\nThat I can\\'t even see\\r\\nAnyone when he\\'s with me\\r\\nHe says he\\'s so in love, he\\'s finally got it right\\r\\nI wonder if he knows he\\'s all I think about at night\\r\\nHe\\'s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\\r\\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star\\r\\nHe\\'s the song in the car\\r\\nI keep singing, don\\'t know why I do...\\r\\nDrew walks by me\\r\\nCan\\'t he tell that I can\\'t breathe?\\r\\nAnd there he goes, so perfectly\\r\\nThe kind of flawless I wish I could be\\r\\nShe\\'d better hold him tight, give him all her love\\r\\nLook in those beautiful eyes and know she\\'s lucky \\'cause\\r\\nHe\\'s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\\r\\nThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star\\r\\nHe\\'s the song in the car\\r\\nI keep singing, don\\'t know why I do...\\r\\nSo I drive home alone, as I turn off the light\\r\\nI\\'ll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight\\r\\nHe\\'s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar\\r\\nThe only one who\\'s got enough of me to break my heart\\r\\nHe\\'s the song in the car\\r\\nI keep singing, don\\'t know why I do...\\r\\nHe\\'s the time taken up, but there\\'s never enough\\r\\nAnd he\\'s all that I need to fall into\\r\\nDrew looks at me\\r\\nI fake a smile so he won\\'t see\\r\\nI don\\'t know what I want, so don\\'t ask me\\r\\nCause I\\'m still trying to figure it out\\r\\nDon\\'t know what\\'s down this road, I\\'m just walking\\r\\nTrying to see through the rain coming down\\r\\nEven though I\\'m not the only one\\r\\nWho feels the way I do\\r\\nI\\'m alone, on my own, and that\\'s all I know\\r\\nI\\'ll be strong, I\\'ll be wrong, oh but life goes on\\r\\nOh, I\\'m just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\\r\\nGot the radio on, my old blue jeans\\r\\nAnd I\\'m wearing my heart on my sleeve\\r\\nFeeling lucky today, got the sunshine\\r\\nCould you tell me what more do I need\\r\\nAnd tomorrow\\'s just a mystery, oh yeah\\r\\nBut that\\'s OK\\r\\nI\\'m alone, on my own, and that\\'s all I know\\r\\nI\\'ll be strong, I\\'ll be wrong, oh but life goes on\\r\\nOh, I\\'m just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\\r\\nMaybe I\\'m just a girl on a mission\\r\\nBut I\\'m ready to fly\\r\\nI\\'m alone, on my own, and that\\'s all I know\\r\\nI\\'ll be strong, I\\'ll be wrong, oh but life goes on\\r\\nOh I\\'m alone, on my own, and that\\'s all I know\\r\\nOh I\\'m just a girl, trying to find a place in this world\\r\\nOh I\\'m just a girl\\r\\nOh I\\'m just a girl, oh, oh\\r\\nOh I\\'m just a girl\\r\\nYou have a way of coming easily to me\\r\\nAnd when you take, you take the very best of me\\r\\nSo I start a fight cause I need to feel something\\r\\nAnd you do what you want cause I\\'m not what you wanted\\r\\nOh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nJust walk away, no use defending words that you will never say\\r\\nAnd now that I\\'m sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nI\\'ve never been anywhere cold as you\\r\\nYou put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\\r\\nAnd I stood there loving you and wished them all away\\r\\nAnd you come away with a great little story\\r\\nOf a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you\\r\\nOh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nJust walk away, no use defending words that you will never say\\r\\nAnd now that I\\'m sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nI\\'ve never been anywhere cold as you\\r\\nYou never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you\\r\\nAnd I know you wouldn\\'t have told nobody if I died, died for you\\r\\n(Died for you)\\r\\nOh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nEvery smile you fake is so condescending\\r\\nCounting all the scars you made\\r\\nAnd now that I\\'m sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nI\\'ve never been anywhere cold as you\\r\\nI didn\\'t know what I would find\\r\\nWhen I went looking for a reason, I know\\r\\nI didn\\'t read between the lines\\r\\nAnd, baby, I\\'ve got nowhere to go\\r\\nI tried to take the road less traveled by\\r\\nBut nothing seems to work the first few times\\r\\nAm I right?\\r\\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\\r\\nNobody ever lets me in\\r\\nI can still see you, this ain\\'t the best view\\r\\nOn the outside looking in\\r\\nI\\'ve been a lot of lonely places\\r\\nI\\'ve never been on the outside\\r\\nYou saw me there, but never knew\\r\\nI would give it all up to be\\r\\nA part of this, a part of you\\r\\nAnd now it\\'s all too late so you see\\r\\nYou could\\'ve helped if you had wanted to\\r\\nBut no one notices until it\\'s too\\r\\nLate to do anything\\r\\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\\r\\nNobody ever lets me in\\r\\nI can still see you, this ain\\'t the best view\\r\\nOn the outside looking in\\r\\nI\\'ve been a lot of lonely places\\r\\nI\\'ve never been on the outside\\r\\nSo how can I ever try to be better?\\r\\nNobody ever lets me in\\r\\nI can still see you, this ain\\'t the best view\\r\\nOn the outside looking in\\r\\nI\\'ve been a lot of lonely places\\r\\nI\\'ve never been on the outside\\r\\nSeems the only one who doesn\\'t see your beauty\\r\\nIs the face in the mirror looking back at you\\r\\nYou walk around here thinking you\\'re not pretty\\r\\nBut that\\'s not true, \\'cause I know you\\r\\nHold on\\r\\nBaby you\\'re losing it\\r\\nThe water\\'s high\\r\\nYou\\'re jumping into it\\r\\nAnd letting go\\r\\nAnd no one knows\\r\\nThat you cry\\r\\nBut you don\\'t tell anyone\\r\\nThat you might\\r\\nNot be the golden one\\r\\nAnd you\\'re tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut you\\'re coming undone\\r\\nI guess it\\'s true that love was all you wanted\\r\\n\\'Cause you\\'re giving it away like it\\'s extra change\\r\\nHoping it will end up in his pocket\\r\\nBut he leaves you out like a penny in the rain\\r\\nOh, \\'cause it\\'s not his price to pay\\r\\nNot his price to pay\\r\\nHold on\\r\\nBaby you\\'re losing it\\r\\nThe water\\'s high\\r\\nYou\\'re jumping into it\\r\\nAnd letting go\\r\\nAnd no one knows\\r\\nThat you cry\\r\\nBut you don\\'t tell anyone\\r\\nThat you might\\r\\nNot be the golden one\\r\\nAnd you\\'re tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut you\\'re coming undone\\r\\nHold on\\r\\nBaby you\\'re losing it\\r\\nThe water\\'s high\\r\\nYou\\'re jumping into it\\r\\nAnd letting go\\r\\nAnd no one knows\\r\\nThat you cry\\r\\nBut you don\\'t tell anyone\\r\\nThat you might\\r\\nNot be the golden one\\r\\nAnd you\\'re tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut you\\'re coming undone\\r\\nYou\\'re tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut you\\'re coming undone oh\\r\\nGoodbye, baby\\r\\nWith a smile, baby, baby\\r\\nCory\\'s eyes are like a jungle\\r\\nHe smiles, it\\'s like the radio\\r\\nHe whispers songs into my window\\r\\nIn words that nobody knows\\r\\nThese pretty girls on every corner\\r\\nThey watch him as he\\'s walking home\\r\\nSaying, \"Does he know?\"\\r\\nWill you ever know?\\r\\nYou\\'re beautiful\\r\\nEvery little piece love\\r\\nAnd don\\'t you know\\r\\nYou\\'re really gonna be someone\\r\\nAsk anyone\\r\\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\\r\\nI hope your life will lead you back to my door\\r\\nOh, but if it don\\'t\\r\\nStay beautiful\\r\\nCory finds another way to be\\r\\nThe highlight of my day\\r\\nI\\'m taking pictures in my mind\\r\\nSo I can save them for a rainy day\\r\\nIt\\'s hard to make a conversation\\r\\nWhen he\\'s taking my breath away\\r\\nI should say, hey, by the way\\r\\nYou\\'re beautiful\\r\\nEvery little piece love\\r\\nAnd don\\'t you know\\r\\nYou\\'re really gonna be someone\\r\\nAsk anyone\\r\\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\\r\\nI hope your life will lead you back to my door\\r\\nOh, but if it don\\'t\\r\\nStay beautiful\\r\\nIf you and I are a story\\r\\nThat never gets told\\r\\nIf what you are is a daydream\\r\\nI\\'ll never get to hold\\r\\nAt least you\\'ll know\\r\\nYou\\'re beautiful\\r\\nEvery little piece love\\r\\nAnd don\\'t you know\\r\\nYou\\'re really gonna be someone\\r\\nAsk anyone\\r\\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\\r\\nI hope your life will lead you back to my front door\\r\\nOh, but if it don\\'t\\r\\nWill you stay\\r\\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful?\\r\\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful?\\r\\nLa la la\\r\\nOh, oh, oh, oh\\r\\nOh, but if it don\\'t\\r\\nStay beautiful\\r\\nStay beautiful\\r\\nNa, na, na, na, na\\r\\nIt\\'s strange to think the songs we used to sing\\r\\nThe smiles, the flowers, everything is gone\\r\\nYesterday I found out about you\\r\\nEven now just looking at you: feels wrong\\r\\nYou say that you\\'d take it all back, given one chance\\r\\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said, \"Yes\"\\r\\nYou should\\'ve said, \"No\", you should\\'ve gone home\\r\\nYou should\\'ve thought twice \\'fore you let it all go\\r\\nYou should\\'ve know that word, \\'bout what you did with her\\r\\nGet back to me (get back to me)\\r\\nAnd I should\\'ve been there, in the back of your mind\\r\\nI shouldn\\'t be asking myself, \"Why?\"\\r\\nYou shouldn\\'t be begging for forgiveness at my feet\\r\\nYou should\\'ve said no, baby, and you might still have me\\r\\nYou can see that I\\'ve been crying\\r\\nBaby you know all the right things to say\\r\\nBut do you honestly expect me to believe\\r\\nWe could ever be the same?\\r\\nYou say that the past is the past, you need one chance\\r\\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said, \"Yes\"\\r\\nYou should\\'ve said, \"No\", you should\\'ve gone home\\r\\nYou should\\'ve thought twice \\'fore you let it all go\\r\\nYou should\\'ve know that word, \\'bout what you did with her\\r\\nGet back to me (get back to me)\\r\\nAnd I should\\'ve been there, in the

can\\'t resist\\r\\nBefore you go tell me this\\r\\nWas it worth it?\\r\\nWas she worth this?\\r\\nNo no, no, no\\r\\nYou should\\'ve said, \"No\", you should\\'ve gone home\\r\\nYou should\\'ve thought twice \\'fore you let it all go\\r\\nYou should\\'ve know that word, \\'bout what you did with her\\r\\nGet back to me (get back to me)\\r\\nAnd I should\\'ve been there, in the back of your

and you were nine\\r\\nI looked at you like the stars that shined\\r\\nIn the sky, the pretty lights\\r\\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\\r\\nGrowing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled\\r\\nAnd rolled their eyes and said oh my my my\\r\\nTake me back to the house in the backyard tree\\r\\nSaid you\\'d beat me up, you were bigger than me\\r\\nYou never did, you never did\\r\\nTake me back when our world was one block wide\\r\\nI dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried\\r\\nJust two kids, you and I\\r\\nOh my my my my\\r\\nWell, I was sixteen when suddenly\\r\\nI wasn\\'t that little girl you used to see\\r\\nBut your eyes still shined like pretty lights\\r\\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\\r\\nThey never believed we\\'d really fall in love\\r\\nAnd our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes\\r\\nAnd said oh my my my\\r\\nTake me back to the creek beds we turned up\\r\\nTwo A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me\\r\\nTake me back to the time we had our very first fight\\r\\nThe slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight\\r\\nYou stayed outside till the morning light\\r\\nOh my my my my\\r\\nA few years had gone and come around\\r\\nWe were sitting at our favorite spot in town\\r\\nAnd you looked at me, got down on one knee\\r\\nTake me back to the time when we walked down the aisle\\r\\nOur whole town came and our mamas cried\\r\\nYou said I do and I did too\\r\\nTake me home where we met so many years before\\r\\nWe\\'ll rock our babies on that very front porch\\r\\nAfter all this time, you and I\\r\\nI\\'ll be eighty-seven; you\\'ll be eighty-nine\\r\\nI\\'ll still look at you like the stars that shine\\r\\nIn the sky, oh my my my\\r\\nI was riding shotgun with my hair undone\\r\\nIn the front seat of his car\\r\\nHe\\'s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel\\r\\nThe other on my heart\\r\\nI look around, turn the radio down\\r\\nHe says, \"Baby is something wrong?\"\\r\\nI say, \"Nothing, I was just thinking\\r\\nHow we don\\'t have a song\"\\r\\nAnd he says\\r\\nOur song is the slamming screen door\\r\\nSneakin\\' out late, tapping on your window\\r\\nWhen we\\'re on the phone and you talk real slow\\r\\n\\'Cause it\\'s late and your mama don\\'t know\\r\\nOur song is the way you laugh\\r\\nThe first date: \"Man, I didn\\'t kiss her, and I should have\"\\r\\nAnd when I got home \\'fore I said amen\\r\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\r\\nI was walking up the front porch steps\\r\\nAfter everything that day\\r\\nHad gone all wrong and been trampled on\\r\\nAnd lost and thrown away\\r\\nGot to the hallway, well on my way\\r\\nTo my lovin\\' bed\\r\\nI almost didn\\'t notice all the roses\\r\\nAnd the note that said\\r\\nOur song is the slamming screen door\\r\\nSneakin\\' out late, tapping on your window\\r\\nWhen we\\'re on the phone and you talk real slow\\r\\n\\'Cause it\\'s late and your mama don\\'t

again\\r\\nI\\'ve heard every album, listened to the radio\\r\\nWaited for something to come along\\r\\nThat was as good as our song\\r\\n\\'Cause our song is the slamming screen door\\r\\nSneakin\\'

I didn\\'t kiss him, and I should have\"\\r\\nAnd when I got home \\'fore I said amen\\r\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\r\\nPlay it again\\r\\nI was riding shotgun with my hair undone\\r\\nIn the front seat of his car\\r\\nI grabbed a pen and an old napkin\\r\\nAnd I wrote down our song\\r\\nFriday night beneath the stars\\r\\nIn a field behind your yard\\r\\nYou and I are painting pictures in the sky\\r\\nAnd sometimes we don\\'t say a thing\\r\\nJust listen to the crickets sing\\r\\nEverything I need is right here by my side\\r\\nAnd I know everything about you\\r\\nI don\\'t wanna live without you\\r\\nI\\'m only up when you\\'re not down\\r\\nDon\\'t wanna fly if you\\'re still on the ground\\r\\nIt\\'s like no matter what I do\\r\\nWell you drive me crazy half the time\\r\\nThe other half I\\'m only trying to let you know that what I feel is true\\r\\nAnd I\\'m only me when I\\'m with you\\r\\nJust a small town boy and girl\\r\\nLiving in a crazy world\\r\\nTrying to figure out what is and isn\\'t true\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t try to hide my tears\\r\\nThe secrets or my deepest fears\\r\\nThrough it all nobody gets me like you do\\r\\nAnd you know everything about me\\r\\nYou say that you can\\'t live without me\\r\\nI\\'m only up when you\\'re not down\\r\\nDon\\'t wanna fly if you\\'re still on the ground\\r\\nIt\\'s like no matter what I do\\r\\nWell you drive me crazy half the time\\r\\nThe other half I\\'m only trying to let you know that what I feel is true\\r\\nAnd I\\'m only me when I\\'m with you\\r\\nWhen I\\'m with anybody else it\\'s so hard to be myself\\r\\nOnly you can tell\\r\\nThat I\\'m only up when you\\'re not down\\r\\nDon\\'t wanna fly if you\\'re still on the ground\\r\\nIt\\'s like no matter what I do\\r\\nWell you drive me crazy half the time\\r\\nThe other half I\\'m only trying to let you know that what I feel is true\\r\\nAnd I\\'m only me\\r\\nWho I wanna be\\r\\nWell, I\\'m only me when I\\'m with you\\r\\nWith you\\r\\nUh huh\\r\\nYeah\\r\\nShe can\\'t see the way your eyes\\r\\nLight up when you smile\\r\\nShe\\'ll never notice how you stop and stare\\r\\nWhenever she walks by\\r\\nAnd you can\\'t see me wanting you the way you want her\\r\\nBut you are everything to me\\r\\nI just want to show you\\r\\nShe don\\'t even know you\\r\\nShe\\'s never going to love you like I want to\\r\\nAnd you just see right through me\\r\\nIf you only knew me\\r\\nWe could be a beautiful\\r\\nMiracle\\r\\nUnbelievable\\r\\nInstead of just invisible\\r\\nThere\\'s a fire inside of you\\r\\nThat can\\'t help but shine through\\r\\nShe\\'s never going to see the light\\r\\nNo matter what you do\\r\\nAnd all I think about is how to make you think of me\\r\\nAnd everything that we could be\\r\\nI just want to show you\\r\\nShe don\\'t even know you\\r\\nShe\\'s never going to love you like I want to\\r\\nAnd you just see right through me\\r\\nIf you only knew me\\r\\nWe could be a beautiful\\r\\nMiracle\\r\\nUnbelievable\\r\\nInstead of just invisible\\r\\nLike shadows in a faded light\\r\\nOh, we\\'re invisible\\r\\nI just want to open your eyes\\r\\nAnd make you realize\\r\\nI just want to show you\\r\\nShe don\\'t even know you\\r\\nBaby, let me love you\\r\\nLet me want you\\r\\nYou just see right through me\\r\\nBut if you only knew me\\r\\nWe could be a beautiful\\r\\nMiracle\\r\\nUnbelievable\\r\\nInstead of just invisible\\r\\nShe can\\'t see the way your eyes\\r\\nLight up when you smile\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nMaybe I should\\'ve seen the signs, should\\'ve read the writing on the wall\\r\\nAnd realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall\\r\\nNo matter what you say, I still can\\'t believe\\r\\nThat you would walk away\\r\\nIt don\\'t make sense to me, but\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nIt\\'s not unbroken anymore\\r\\nHow do I get it back the way it was before?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?\\r\\nWhy would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\\r\\nThere\\'s something \\'bout the way\\r\\nThe street looks when it\\'s just rained\\r\\nThere\\'s a glow off the pavement\\r\\nYou walk me to the car\\r\\nAnd you know I wanna ask you to dance right there\\r\\nIn the middle of the parking lot, yeah\\r\\nOh, yeah\\r\\nWe\\'re driving down the road\\r\\nI wonder if you know\\r\\nI\\'m trying so hard not to get caught up now\\r\\nBut you\\'re just so cool\\r\\nRun your hands through your hair\\r\\nAbsent mindedly making me want you\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know how it gets better than this\\r\\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know why but with you I\\'d dance in a storm in my best dress\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nSo baby drive slow\\r\\n\\'til we run out of road in this one horse town\\r\\nI wanna stay right here in this passenger\\'s seat\\r\\nYou put your eyes on me\\r\\nIn this moment now capture it, remember it\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know how it gets better than this\\r\\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know why but with you I\\'d dance in a storm in my best dress\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nWell you stood there with me in the doorway\\r\\nMy hands shake, I\\'m not usually this way but\\r\\nYou pull me in and I\\'m a little more brave\\r\\nIt\\'s the first kiss, it\\'s flawless, really something\\r\\nIt\\'s fearless\\r\\nOh, yeah\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know how it gets better than this\\r\\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know why but with you I\\'d dance in a storm in my best dress\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know how it gets better than this\\r\\nYou take my hand and drag me head first\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know why but with you I\\'d dance in a storm in my best dress\\r\\nFearless\\r\\nOh oh\\r\\nOh yeah\\r\\nYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\\r\\nIt\\'s the morning of your very first day\\r\\nYou say hi to your friends you ain\\'t seen in a while\\r\\nTry and stay out of everybody\\'s way\\r\\nIt\\'s your freshman year and you\\'re going to be here\\r\\nFor the next four years in this town\\r\\nHoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\\r\\n\"You know, I haven\\'t seen you around before\"\\r\\nBecause when you\\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\r\\nYou\\'re going to believe them\\r\\nAnd when you\\'re fifteen feeling like there\\'s nothing to figure out\\r\\nWell, count to ten, take it in\\r\\nThis is life before you know who you\\'re going to be\\r\\nFifteen\\r\\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\\r\\nAnd soon enough you\\'re best friends\\r\\nLaughing at the other girls who think they\\'re so cool\\r\\nWe\\'ll be outta here as soon as we can\\r\\nAnd then you\\'re on your very first date and he\\'s got a car\\r\\nAnd you\\'re feeling like flying\\r\\nAnd your momma\\'s waiting up and you\\'re thinking he\\'s the one\\r\\nAnd you\\'re dancing \\'round your room when the night ends\\r\\nWhen the night ends\\r\\nBecause when you\\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\r\\nYou\\'re going to believe them\\r\\nWhen you\\'re fifteen and your first kiss\\r\\nMakes your head spin \\'round\\r\\nBut in your life you\\'ll do things greater than\\r\\nDating the boy on the football team\\r\\nBut I didn\\'t know it at fifteen\\r\\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\\r\\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\\r\\nBack then I swore I was going to marry him someday\\r\\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\\r\\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had to a boy\\r\\nWho changed his mind and we both cried\\r\\nBecause when you\\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\r\\nYou\\'re going to believe them\\r\\nAnd when you\\'re fifteen, don\\'t forget to look before you fall\\r\\nI\\'ve found time can heal most anything\\r\\nAnd you just might find who you\\'re supposed to be\\r\\nI didn\\'t know who I was supposed to be at fifteen\\r\\nLa la la la la la la la la la\\r\\nLa la la la la la la la la la\\r\\nLa la la la la la\\r\\nYour very first day\\r\\nTake a deep breath girl\\r\\nTake a deep breath as you walk through the doors\\r\\nWe were both young when I first saw you\\r\\nI close my eyes, and the flashback starts\\r\\nI\\'m standing there\\r\\nOn a balcony in summer air\\r\\nSee the lights, see the party, the ball gowns\\r\\nSee you make your way through the crowd\\r\\nAnd say, \"hello\"\\r\\nLittle did I know\\r\\nThat you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles\\r\\nAnd my daddy said, \"stay away from Juliet\"\\r\\nAnd I was crying on the staircase\\r\\nBegging you, \"please don\\'t go,\" and I said\\r\\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\\r\\nI\\'ll be waiting, all there\\'s left to do is run\\r\\nYou\\'ll be the prince and I\\'ll be the princess\\r\\nIt\\'s a love story baby just say \"yes\"\\r\\nSo I sneak out to the garden to see you\\r\\nWe keep quiet, \\'cause we\\'re dead if they knew\\r\\nSo close your eyes\\r\\nEscape this town for a little while\\r\\n\\'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter\\r\\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\\r\\nBut you were everything to me\\r\\nI was begging you please don\\'t go and I said\\r\\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\\r\\nI\\'ll be waiting, all there\\'s left to do is run\\r\\nYou\\'ll be the prince and I\\'ll be the princess\\r\\nIt\\'s a love story baby just say \"yes\"\\r\\nRomeo, save me, they\\'re trying to tell me how to feel\\r\\nThis love is difficult, but it\\'s real\\r\\nDon\\'t be afraid, we\\'ll make it out of this mess\\r\\nIt\\'s a love story baby just say \"yes\"\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nI got tired of waiting\\r\\nWondering if you were ever coming around\\r\\nMy faith in you was fading\\r\\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said\\r\\nRomeo save me I\\'ve been feeling so alone\\r\\nI keep waiting for you but you never come\\r\\nIs this in my head? I don\\'t know what to think\\r\\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring\\r\\nAnd said: \"Marry me Juliet\\r\\nYou\\'ll never have to be alone\\r\\nI love you and that\\'s all I really know\\r\\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\\r\\nIt\\'s a love story baby just say \\'yes\\'\"\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nBecause we were both young when I first saw you\\r\\nHey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving\\r\\nBut I know I saw a light in you\\r\\nAnd as we walked we were talking\\r\\nI didn\\'t say half the things I wanted to\\r\\nOf all the girls tossing rocks at your window\\r\\nI\\'ll be the one waiting there even when it\\'s cold\\r\\nHey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing\\r\\nI don\\'t always have to be alone\\r\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t help it if you look like an angel\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\\r\\nCome feel this magic I\\'ve been feeling since I met you\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if there\\'s no one else\\r\\nMmm, I can\\'t help myself\\r\\nHey Stephen, I\\'ve been holding back this feeling\\r\\nSo I got some things to say to you\\r\\nI\\'ve seen it all, so I thought\\r\\nBut I never seen nobody shine the way you do\\r\\nThe way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name\\r\\nIt\\'s beautiful, wonderful, don\\'t you ever change\\r\\nHey Stephen, why are people always leaving?\\r\\nI think you and I should stay the same\\r\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t help it if you look like an angel\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\\r\\nCome feel this magic I\\'ve been feeling since I met you\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if there\\'s no one else\\r\\nMmm, I can\\'t help myself\\r\\nThey\\'re dimming the street lights, you\\'re perfect for me\\r\\nWhy aren\\'t you here tonight?\\r\\nI\\'m waiting alone now, so come on and come out\\r\\nAnd pull me near and shine, shine, shine\\r\\nHey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons\\r\\nWhy I should be the one you choose\\r\\nAll those other girls, well, they\\'re beautiful\\r\\nBut would they write a song for you?\\r\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t help it if you look like an angel\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\\r\\nCome feel this magic I\\'ve been feeling since I met you\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if there\\'s no one else\\r\\nMmm, I can\\'t help myself\\r\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t help it if you look like an angel\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\\r\\nCome feel this magic I\\'ve been feeling since I met you\\r\\nCan\\'t help it if there\\'s no one else\\r\\nMmm, I can\\'t help myself\\r\\nMyself\\r\\nCan\\'t help myself\\r\\nI can\\'t help myself\\r\\nSay you\\'re sorry, that face of an angel\\r\\nComes out just when you need it to\\r\\nAs I paced back and forth all this time\\r\\n\\'Cause I honestly believed in you\\r\\nHoldin\\' on, the days drag on\\r\\nStupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known\\r\\nThat I\\'m not a princess, this ain\\'t a fairytale\\r\\nI\\'m not the one you\\'ll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell\\r\\nThis ain\\'t Hollywood, this is a small town\\r\\nI was a dreamer before you went and let me down\\r\\nNow it\\'s too late for you and your white horse\\r\\nTo come around\\r\\nBaby I was naive, got lost in your eyes\\r\\nAnd never really had a chance\\r\\nMy mistake I didn\\'t know to be in love\\r\\nYou had to fight to have the upper hand\\r\\nI had so many dreams about you and me\\r\\nHappy endings, now I know\\r\\nThat I\\'m not a princess, this ain\\'t a fairytale\\r\\nI\\'m not the one you\\'ll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell\\r\\nThis ain\\'t Hollywood, this is a small town\\r\\nI was a dreamer before you went and let me down\\r\\nNow it\\'s too late for you and your white horse\\r\\nTo come around\\r\\nAnd there you are on your knees\\r\\nBeggin\\' for forgiveness, beggin\\' for me\\r\\nJust like I always wanted\\r\\nBut I\\'m so sorry\\r\\n\\'Cause I\\'m not your princess, this ain\\'t our fairytale\\r\\nI\\'m gonna find someone someday\\r\\nWho might actually treat me well\\r\\nThis is a big world, that was a small town\\r\\nThere in my rear view mirror disappearing now\\r\\nAnd it\\'s too late for you and your white horse\\r\\nNow it\\'s too late for you and your white horse\\r\\nTo catch me now\\r\\nOh, whoa, whoa, whoa\\r\\nTry and catch me now, oh\\r\\nIt\\'s too late to catch me now\\r\\nYou\\'re on the phone with your girlfriend, she\\'s upset\\r\\nShe\\'s going off about something that you said\\r\\n\\'Cause she doesn\\'t get your humor like I do\\r\\nI\\'m in the room, it\\'s a typical Tuesday night\\r\\nI\\'m listening to the kind of music she doesn\\'t like\\r\\nAnd she\\'ll never know your story like I do\\r\\nBut she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts\\r\\nShe\\'s Cheer Captain and I\\'m on the bleachers\\r\\nDreaming about the day when you wake up and find\\r\\nThat what you\\'re looking for has been here the whole time\\r\\nIf you could see that I\\'m the one who understands you\\r\\nBeen here all along, so why can\\'t you see?\\r\\nYou belong with me, you belong with me\\r\\nWalking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans\\r\\nI can\\'t help thinking this is how it ought to be\\r\\nLaughing on a park bench, thinking to myself\\r\\nHey, isn\\'t this easy?\\r\\nAnd you\\'ve got a smile that could light up this whole town\\r\\nI haven\\'t seen it in a while since she brought you down\\r\\nYou say you\\'re fine, I know you better than that\\r\\nHey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?\\r\\nShe wears high heels, I wear sneakers\\r\\nShe\\'s Cheer Captain and I\\'m on the bleachers\\r\\nDreaming about the day when you wake up and find\\r\\nThat what you\\'re looking for has been here the whole time\\r\\nIf you could see that I\\'m the one who understands you\\r\\nBeen here all along, so why can\\'t you see?\\r\\nYou belong with me\\r\\nStanding by and waiting at your back door\\r\\nAll this time how could you not know, baby?\\r\\nYou belong with me, you belong with me\\r\\nOh, I remember you driving to my house\\r\\nIn the middle of the night\\r\\nI\\'m the one who makes you laugh\\r\\nWhen you know you\\'re \\'bout to cry\\r\\nAnd I know your favorite songs\\r\\nAnd you tell me \\'bout your dreams\\r\\nThink I know where you belong\\r\\nThink I know it\\'s with me\\r\\nCan\\'t you see that I\\'m the one who understands you\\r\\nBeen here all along, so why can\\'t you see?\\r\\nYou belong with me\\r\\nStanding by and waiting at your back door\\r\\nAll this time how could you not know, baby?\\r\\nYou belong with me, you belong with me\\r\\nYou belong with me\\r\\nHave you ever thought just maybe\\r\\nYou belong with me?\\r\\nYou belong with me\\r\\nI see your face in my mind as I drive away\\r\\n\\'Cause none of us thought it was\\r\\nGoing to end that way\\r\\nPeople are people\\r\\nAnd sometimes we change our minds\\r\\nBut it\\'s killing me to see you go after all this time\\r\\nMm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm\\r\\nMm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm\\r\\nMusic starts playing like the end of a sad movie\\r\\nIt\\'s the kind of ending you\\r\\nDon\\'t really want to see\\r\\n\\'Cause it\\'s tragedy and it\\'ll only bring you\\r\\nDown\\r\\nNow I don\\'t know what to be without you around\\r\\nAnd we know it\\'s never simple, never easy\\r\\nNever a clean break, no one here to\\r\\nSave me\\r\\nYou\\'re the only thing I know like the back of my hand\\r\\nAnd I can\\'t\\r\\nBreathe\\r\\nWithout you but I have to breathe\\r\\nWithout you but I have to\\r\\nNever wanted this, never want to see you hurt\\r\\nEvery little bump in the road I tried to swerve\\r\\nBut people are people\\r\\nAnd sometimes it doesn\\'t work out\\r\\nNothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out\\r\\nIt\\'s 2 A.M\\r\\nFeeling like I just lost a friend\\r\\nHope you know it\\'s not easy\\r\\nEasy for me\\r\\nIt\\'s 2 A.M\\r\\nFeeling like I just lost a friend\\r\\nHope you know this ain\\'t easy\\r\\nEasy for me\\r\\nSorry, sorry\\r\\nSorry, (Yeah eh) sorry\\r\\nSorry, sorry\\r\\nSorry\\r\\nI took a chance\\r\\nI took a shot\\r\\nAnd you might think I\\'m bulletproof\\r\\nBut I\\'m not\\r\\nYou took a swing\\r\\nI took it hard\\r\\nAnd down here from the ground I see who you are\\r\\nI\\'m sick and tired of your attitude\\r\\nI\\'m feeling like I don\\'t know you\\r\\nYou tell me that you love me, then you cut me down\\r\\nAnd I need you like a heartbeat\\r\\nBut you know you got a mean streak\\r\\nThat makes me run for cover when you\\'re around\\r\\nAnd here\\'s to you and your temper\\r\\nYes, I remember what you said last night\\r\\nAnd I know, that you see, what you\\'re doing to me\\r\\nTell me why\\r\\nYou could write a book on how to ruin someone\\'s perfect day\\r\\nWell I get so confused and frustrated\\r\\nForget what I\\'m trying to say, oh\\r\\nI\\'m sick and tired of your reasons\\r\\nI got no one to believe in\\r\\nYou tell me that you want me, then push me around\\r\\nAnd I need you like a heartbeat\\r\\nBut you know you got a mean streak\\r\\nThat makes me run for cover when you\\'re around\\r\\nHere\\'s to you and your temper\\r\\nYes, I remember what you said last night\\r\\nAnd I know, that you see, what you\\'re doing to me\\r\\nTell me why\\r\\nWhy do you have to make me feel small\\r\\nSo you can feel whole inside?\\r\\nWhy do you have to put down my dreams\\r\\nSo you\\'re the only thing on my mind?\\r\\nI\\'m sick and tired of your attitude\\r\\nI\\'m feeling like I don\\'t know you\\r\\nYou tell me that you want me, then cut me down\\r\\nI\\'m sick and tired of your reasons\\r\\nI\\'ve got no one to believe in\\r\\nYou ask me for my love, then you push me around\\r\\nHere\\'s to you and your temper\\r\\nYes, I remember what you said last night\\r\\nAnd I know that you see what you\\'re doing to me\\r\\nTell me why (why)\\r\\nTell me why (why)\\r\\nI take a step back, let you go\\r\\nI told you I\\'m not bulletproof\\r\\nNow you know\\r\\nAll this time I was wasting hoping you would come around\\r\\nI\\'ve been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down\\r\\nAnd it\\'s taken me this long baby but I\\'ve figured you out\\r\\nAnd you\\'re thinking we\\'ll be fine again but not this time around\\r\\nYou don\\'t have to call anymore\\r\\nI won\\'t pick up the phone\\r\\nThis is the last straw\\r\\nDon\\'t wanna hurt anymore\\r\\nAnd you can tell me that you\\'re sorry\\r\\nBut I don\\'t believe you baby like I did before\\r\\nYou\\'re not sorry (No no no no)\\r\\nYou\\'re looking so innocent\\r\\nI might believe you if I didn\\'t know\\r\\nCould\\'ve loved you all my life if you hadn\\'t left me waiting in the cold\\r\\nAnd you\\'ve got your share of secrets\\r\\nAnd I\\'m tired of being last to know\\r\\nAnd now you\\'re asking me to listen \\'cause it\\'s worked each time before but\\r\\nYou don\\'t have to call anymore\\r\\nI won\\'t pick up the phone\\r\\nThis is the last straw\\r\\nDon\\'t wanna hurt anymore\\r\\nAnd you can tell me that you\\'re sorry\\r\\nBut I don\\'t believe you baby like I did before\\r\\nYou\\'re not sorry (No no no no)\\r\\nYou\\'re not sorry (No no no no)\\r\\nYou had me crawling for you honey and it never would have gone away\\r\\nYou used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so\\r\\nYou don\\'t have to call anymore\\r\\nI won\\'t pick up the phone\\r\\nThis is the last straw\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing left to beg for\\r\\nAnd you can tell me that you\\'re sorry\\r\\nBut I don\\'t believe you baby like I did before\\r\\nYou\\'re not sorry (No no no no)\\r\\nYou\\'re not sorry (No no no no)\\r\\n(No, no, no...)\\r\\nHe is sensible and so incredible\\r\\nAnd all my single friends are jealous\\r\\nHe says everything I need to hear and it\\'s like\\r\\nI couldn\\'t ask for anything better\\r\\nHe opens up my door and I get into his car\\r\\nAnd he says you look beautiful tonight\\r\\nAnd I feel perfectly fine\\r\\nBut I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\\r\\nAnd it\\'s 2am and I\\'m cursing your name\\r\\nYou\\'re so in love that you act insane\\r\\nAnd that\\'s the way I loved you\\r\\nBreaking down and coming undone\\r\\nIt\\'s a roller coaster kind of rush\\r\\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\\r\\nAnd that\\'s the way I loved you\\r\\nHe respects my space\\r\\nAnd never makes me wait\\r\\nAnd he calls exactly when he says he will\\r\\nHe\\'s close to my mother\\r\\nTalks business with my father\\r\\nHe\\'s charming and endearing\\r\\nAnd I\\'m comfortable\\r\\nHe can\\'t see the smile I\\'m faking\\r\\nAnd my heart\\'s not breaking\\r\\n\\'Cause I\\'m not feeling anything at all\\r\\nAnd you were wild and crazy\\r\\nJust so frustrating intoxicating\\r\\nComplicated, got away by some mistake and now\\r\\nI miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\\r\\nIt\\'s 2am and I\\'m cursing your name\\r\\nI\\'m so in love that I acted insane\\r\\nAnd that\\'s the way I loved you\\r\\nBreaking down and coming undone\\r\\nIt\\'s a roller coaster kind of rush\\r\\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\\r\\nAnd that\\'s the way I loved you oh, oh\\r\\nAnd that\\'s the way I loved you oh, oh\\r\\nNever knew I could feel that much\\r\\nAnd that\\'s the way I loved you\\r\\nOnce upon a time\\r\\nI believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye\\r\\nAnd we caught onto something\\r\\nI hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me\\r\\nWere you just kidding?\\r\\n\\'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down\\r\\nWe almost never speak\\r\\nI don\\'t feel welcome anymore\\r\\nBaby what happened, please tell me?\\r\\n\\'Cause one second it was perfect, now you\\'re halfway out the door\\r\\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn\\'t called\\r\\nAnd then you feel so low you can\\'t feel nothing at all\\r\\nAnd you flashback to when he said forever and always\\r\\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\\r\\nEverything is wrong\\r\\nIt rains when you\\'re here and it rains when you\\'re gone\\r\\n\\'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\\r\\nWas I out of line?\\r\\nDid I say something way too honest, made you run and hide\\r\\nLike a scared little boy\\r\\nI looked into your eyes\\r\\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I\\'m not so sure\\r\\nSo here\\'s to everything coming down to nothing\\r\\nHere\\'s to silence that cuts me to the core\\r\\nWhere is this going?\\r\\nThought I knew for a minute, but I don\\'t anymore\\r\\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn\\'t called\\r\\nAnd then you feel so low you can\\'t feel nothing at all\\r\\nAnd you flashback to when he said forever and always\\r\\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\\r\\nEverything is wrong\\r\\nIt rains when you\\'re here and it rains when you\\'re gone\\r\\n\\'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\\r\\nYou didn\\'t mean it baby, I don\\'t think so\\r\\nOh, back up, baby, back up\\r\\nDid you forget everything?\\r\\nBack up, baby, back up\\r\\nDid you forget everything?\\r\\n\\'Cause it rains in your bedroom\\r\\nEverything is wrong\\r\\nIt rains when you\\'re here and it rains when you\\'re gone\\r\\n\\'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\\r\\nOh I stare at the phone, he still hasn\\'t called\\r\\nAnd then you feel so low you can\\'t feel nothing at all\\r\\nAnd you flashback to when we said forever and always\\r\\nAnd  it rains in your bedroom\\r\\nEverything is wrong\\r\\nIt rains when you\\'re here and it rains when you\\'re gone\\r\\n\\'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\\r\\nYou didn\\'t mean it baby, you said forever and always, yeah\\r\\nI\\'m five years old, it\\'s getting cold, I\\'ve got my big coat on\\r\\nI hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run\\r\\nPast the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides\\r\\nLook now, the sky is gold\\r\\nI hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home\\r\\nI don\\'t know why all the trees change in the fall\\r\\nBut I know you\\'re not scared of anything at all\\r\\nDon\\'t know if Snow White\\'s house is near or far away\\r\\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\\r\\nI\\'m thirteen now\\r\\nAnd don\\'t know how my friends could be so mean\\r\\nI come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys\\r\\nAnd we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away\\r\\nAnd we talk and window shop \\'til I\\'ve forgotten all their names\\r\\nI don\\'t know who I\\'m going to talk to now at school\\r\\nBut I know I\\'m laughing on the car ride home with you\\r\\nDon\\'t know how long it\\'s going to take to feel okay\\r\\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\\r\\nI have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger\\r\\nGod smiles on my little brother, inside and out\\r\\nHe\\'s better than I am\\r\\nI grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run\\r\\nAnd I had the best days with you\\r\\nThere is a video I found from back when I was three\\r\\nYou set up a paint set in the kitchen and you\\'re talking to me\\r\\nIt\\'s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs\\r\\nAnd Daddy\\'s smart\\r\\nAnd you\\'re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world\\r\\nAnd now I know why all the trees change in the fall\\r\\nI know you were on my side even when I was wrong\\r\\nAnd I love you for giving me your eyes\\r\\nFor staying back and watching me shine\\r\\nAnd I didn\\'t know if you knew, so I\\'m taking this chance to say\\r\\nThat I had the best day with you today\\r\\nAnd it\\'s a sad picture, the final blow hits you\\r\\nSomebody else gets what you wanted again and\\r\\nYou know it\\'s all the same, another time and place\\r\\nRepeating history and you\\'re getting sick of it\\r\\nBut I believe in whatever you do\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll do anything to see it through\\r\\nBecause these things will change\\r\\nCan you feel it now?\\r\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\\r\\nThis revolution, the time will come\\r\\nFor us to finally win\\r\\nAnd we\\'ll sing hallelujah, we\\'ll sing hallelujah\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nSo we\\'ve been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered\\r\\nIt\\'s hard to fight when the fight ain\\'t fair\\r\\nWe\\'re getting stronger now, finding things they never found\\r\\nThey might be bigger but we\\'re faster and never scared\\r\\nYou can walk away, say we don\\'t need this\\r\\nBut there\\'s something in your eyes says we can beat this\\r\\n\\'Cause these things will change\\r\\nCan you feel it now?\\r\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\\r\\nThis revolution, the time will come\\r\\nFor us to finally win\\r\\nAnd we\\'ll sing hallelujah, we\\'ll sing hallelujah\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nTonight we stand, get off our knees\\r\\nFight for what we\\'ve worked for all these years\\r\\nAnd the battle was long, it\\'s the fight of our lives\\r\\nBut we\\'ll stand up champions tonight\\r\\nIt was the night things changed\\r\\nCan you see it now?\\r\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back fell down\\r\\nIt\\'s a revolution, throw your hands up\\r\\n\\'Cause we never gave in\\r\\nAnd we\\'ll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah\\r\\nHallelujah\\r\\nYou were in college, working part-time, waiting tables\\r\\nLeft a small town and never looked back\\r\\nI was a flight risk, with a fear of falling\\r\\nWondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts\\r\\nI say, \"Can you believe it?\"\\r\\nAs we\\'re lying on the couch\\r\\nThe moment, I could see it\\r\\nYes, yes, I can see it now\\r\\nDo you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?\\r\\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\\r\\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\r\\nYou are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\r\\nFlash forward, and we\\'re taking on the world together\\r\\nAnd there\\'s a drawer of my things at your place\\r\\nYou learn my secrets and figure out why I\\'m guarded\\r\\nYou say we\\'ll never make my parents\\' mistakes\\r\\nBut we got bills to pay\\r\\nWe got nothing figured out\\r\\nWhen it was hard to take\\r\\nYes, yes\\r\\nThis is what I thought about:\\r\\nDo you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?\\r\\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\\r\\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\r\\nYou are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\r\\nDo you remember all the city lights on the water?\\r\\nYou saw me start to believe for the first time\\r\\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\r\\nYou are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\r\\nAnd I remember that fight, 2:30 AM\\r\\nAs everything was slipping right out of our hands\\r\\nI ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street\\r\\nBraced myself for the goodbye\\r\\n\\'Cause that\\'s all I\\'ve ever known\\r\\nThen, you took me by surprise\\r\\nYou said, \"I\\'ll never leave you alone.\"\\r\\nYou said, \"I remember how we felt, sitting by the water\\r\\nAnd every time I look at you, it\\'s like the first time\\r\\nI fell in love with a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\r\\nShe is the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\"\\r\\nHold on, make it last\\r\\nHold on, never turn back\\r\\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\r\\nYou are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\r\\nYeah, yeah\\r\\nDo you believe it?\\r\\n(Hold on)\\r\\nWe\\'re gonna make it now\\r\\n(Hold on)\\r\\nAnd I can see it\\r\\nYeah, yeah\\r\\nI can see it now (see it now)\\r\\nThe way you move is like a full on rainstorm\\r\\nAnd I\\'m a house of cards\\r\\nYou\\'re the kind of reckless\\r\\nThat should send me running\\r\\nBut I kinda know that I won\\'t get far\\r\\nAnd you stood there in front of me\\r\\nJust close enough to touch\\r\\nClose enough to hope you couldn\\'t see\\r\\nWhat I was thinking of\\r\\nDrop everything now\\r\\nMeet me in the pouring rain\\r\\nKiss me on the sidewalk\\r\\nTake away the pain\\r\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\\r\\nGive me something that\\'ll haunt me when you\\'re not around\\r\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nMy mind forgets to remind me\\r\\nYou\\'re a bad idea\\r\\nYou touch me once and it\\'s really something\\r\\nYou find I\\'m even better than you imagined I would be\\r\\nI\\'m on my guard for the rest of the world\\r\\nBut with you I know it\\'s no good\\r\\nAnd I could wait patiently but I really wish you would\\r\\nDrop everything now\\r\\nMeet me in the pouring rain\\r\\nKiss me on the sidewalk\\r\\nTake away the pain\\r\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\\r\\nGive me something that\\'ll haunt me when you\\'re not around\\r\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nI run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild\\r\\nJust keep on keeping your eyes on me, it\\'s just wrong enough to make it feel right\\r\\nAnd lead me up the staircase\\r\\nWon\\'t you whisper soft and slow?\\r\\nI\\'m captivated by you, baby, like a firework show\\r\\nDrop everything now\\r\\nMeet me in the pouring rain\\r\\nKiss me on the sidewalk\\r\\nTake away the pain\\r\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\\r\\nGive me something that\\'ll haunt me when you\\'re not around\\r\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nAnd the sparks fly\\r\\nOh, baby, smile\\r\\nAnd the sparks fly\\r\\nI\\'m so glad you made time to see me\\r\\nHow\\'s life, tell me, how\\'s your family\\r\\nI haven\\'t seen them in a while\\r\\nYou\\'ve been good, busier than ever\\r\\nWe small talk, work and the weather\\r\\nYour guard is up and I know why\\r\\n\\'Cause the last time you saw me\\r\\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\\r\\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\\r\\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\\r\\nStanding in front of you, saying I\\'m sorry for that night\\r\\nAnd I\\'d go back to December all the time\\r\\nIt turns out freedom ain\\'t nothing but missing you\\r\\nWishing I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine\\r\\nI\\'d go back to December, turn around and make it alright\\r\\nI go back to December all the time\\r\\nThese days I haven\\'t been sleeping\\r\\nStaying up playing back myself leaving\\r\\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn\\'t call\\r\\nAnd I think about summer, all the beautiful times\\r\\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side and\\r\\nRealized I loved you in the fall\\r\\nAnd then the cold came\\r\\nThe dark days when fear crept into my mind\\r\\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\\r\\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\\r\\nStanding in front of you, saying I\\'m sorry for that night\\r\\nAnd I\\'d go back to December all the time\\r\\nIt turns out freedom ain\\'t nothing but missing you\\r\\nWishing I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine\\r\\nI\\'d go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\\r\\nI go back to December all the time\\r\\nI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right\\r\\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\\r\\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\\r\\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\\r\\nProbably mindless dreaming\\r\\nBut if we loved again I swear I\\'d love you right\\r\\nI\\'d go back in time and change it, but I can\\'t\\r\\nSo if the chain is on your door, I understand\\r\\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\\r\\nStanding in front of you saying I\\'m sorry for that night\\r\\nAnd I\\'d go back to December...\\r\\nIt turns out freedom ain\\'t nothing but missing you\\r\\nWishing I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine\\r\\nI\\'d go back to December, turn around and make it alright\\r\\nI\\'d go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\\r\\nI go back to December all the time\\r\\nAll the time\\r\\nI am not the kind of girl\\r\\nWho should be rudely barging in\\r\\nOn a white veil occasion\\r\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\r\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\\r\\nI sneak in and see your friends\\r\\nAnd her snotty little family\\r\\nAll dressed in pastel\\r\\nAnd she is yelling at a bridesmaid\\r\\nSomewhere back inside a room\\r\\nWearing a gown shaped like a pastry\\r\\nThis is surely not\\r\\nWhat you thought it would be\\r\\nI lose myself in a daydream\\r\\nWhere I stand and say\\r\\nDon\\'t say yes, run away now\\r\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said \"speak now\"\\r\\nFond gestures are exchanged\\r\\nAnd the organ starts to play\\r\\nA song that sounds like a death march\\r\\nAnd I am hiding in the curtains\\r\\nIt seems that I was uninvited\\r\\nBy your lovely bride-to-be\\r\\nShe floats down the aisle\\r\\nLike a pageant queen\\r\\nBut I know you wish it was me\\r\\nYou wish it was me (Don\\'t you)\\r\\nDon\\'t say yes, run away now\\r\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said \"speak now\"\\r\\nDon\\'t say yes, run away now\\r\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said \"speak now\"\\r\\nOoh, la-da-da-da, oh\\r\\nOoh, ooh\\r\\n(Say a single vow)\\r\\nI hear the preacher say\\r\\n\"Speak now or forever hold your peace\"\\r\\nThere\\'s the silence, there\\'s my last chance\\r\\nI stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me\\r\\nHorrified looks from everyone in the room\\r\\nBut I\\'m only looking at you\\r\\nI am not the kind of girl\\r\\nWho should be rudely barging in\\r\\nOn a white veil occasion\\r\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\r\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\\r\\n(Hehe!)\\r\\nDon\\'t say yes, run away now\\r\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said \"speak now\"\\r\\nAnd you say\\r\\n\"Let\\'s run away now\\r\\nI\\'ll meet you when\\r\\nI\\'m out of my tux at the back door\"\\r\\nBaby, I didn\\'t say my vows\\r\\nSo glad you were around when they said\\r\\n\"Speak now\"\\r\\nLong were the nights when\\r\\nMy days once revolved around you\\r\\nCounting my footsteps\\r\\nPraying the floor won\\'t fall through... again\\r\\nMy mother accused me of losing my mind\\r\\nBut I swore I was fine\\r\\nYou paint me a blue sky\\r\\nThen go back and turn it to rain\\r\\nAnd I lived in your chess game\\r\\nBut you changed the rules everyday\\r\\nWonderin\\' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight\\r\\nWell I stopped pickin\\' up and this song is to let you know why\\r\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone\\r\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\r\\nI shoulda\\' known\\r\\nWell maybe it\\'s me\\r\\nAnd my blind optimism to blame\\r\\nOr maybe it\\'s you and your sick need\\r\\nTo give love and take it away\\r\\nAnd you\\'ll add my name to your long list of traitors\\r\\nWho don\\'t understand\\r\\nAnd I look back in regret how I ignored when they said\\r\\n\"Run as fast as you can\"\\r\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone\\r\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\r\\nDear John, I see it all now it was wrong\\r\\nDon\\'t you think nineteen\\'s too young\\r\\nTo be played by your dark, twisted games\\r\\nWhen I loved you so?\\r\\nI shoulda\\' known\\r\\nYou are an expert at sorry\\r\\nAnd keeping the lines blurry\\r\\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\\r\\nAll the girls that you\\'ve run dry have tired lifeless eyes\\r\\n\\'Cause you burned them out\\r\\nBut I took your matches\\r\\nBefore fire could catch me\\r\\nSo don\\'t look now\\r\\nI\\'m shining like fireworks\\r\\nOver your sad empty town, yeah\\r\\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\\r\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone\\r\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\r\\nI see it all now that you\\'re gone\\r\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress\\r\\nWrote you a song, you shoulda\\' known\\r\\nYou shoulda\\' known\\r\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young\\r\\nYou shoulda\\' known\\r\\nYou, with your words like knives\\r\\nAnd swords and weapons that you use against me\\r\\nYou have knocked me off my feet again\\r\\nGot me feeling like I\\'m nothing\\r\\nYou, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\\r\\nCalling me out when I\\'m wounded\\r\\nYou, picking on the weaker man\\r\\nBut you can take me down with just one single blow\\r\\nBut you don\\'t know what you don\\'t know\\r\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be living in a big old city\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\r\\nYou, with your switching sides\\r\\nAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliation\\r\\nYou have pointed out my flaws again\\r\\nAs if I don\\'t already see them\\r\\nI walk with my head down, trying to block you out\\r\\n\\'Cause I\\'ll never impress you\\r\\nI just want to feel okay again\\r\\nI bet you got pushed around\\r\\nSomebody made you cold\\r\\nBut the cycle ends right now\\r\\n\\'Cause you can\\'t lead me down that road\\r\\nAnd you don\\'t know what you don\\'t know\\r\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be living in a big old city\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\r\\nAnd I can see you years from now in a bar\\r\\nTalking over a football game\\r\\nWith that same big loud opinion\\r\\nBut nobody\\'s listening\\r\\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\\r\\nDrunk and grumbling on about how I can\\'t sing\\r\\nBut all you are is mean\\r\\nAll you are is mean\\r\\nAnd a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life\\r\\nAnd mean, and mean, and mean, and mean\\r\\nBut someday I\\'ll be living in a big old city\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever going to be is mean, yeah!\\r\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever going to be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\r\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be living in a big old city\\r\\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\r\\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\\r\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\r\\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\\r\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\r\\nI used to think one day we\\'d tell the story of us\\r\\nHow we met\\r\\nAnd the sparks flew instantly\\r\\nAnd people would say they\\'re the lucky ones\\r\\nI used to know my place was a spot next to you\\r\\nNow I\\'m searching the room for an empty seat\\r\\n\\'Cause lately I don\\'t even know what page you\\'re on\\r\\nOh, a simple complication\\r\\nMiscommunications lead to fallout\\r\\nSo many things that I wish you knew\\r\\nSo many walls up that I can\\'t break through\\r\\nNow I\\'m standing alone in a crowded room\\r\\nAnd we\\'re not speaking\\r\\nAnd I\\'m dying to know\\r\\nIs it killing you like it\\'s killing me?\\r\\nYeah, I don\\'t know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down\\r\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\\r\\nNext chapter\\r\\nHow\\'d we end up this way?\\r\\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy\\r\\nAnd you\\'re doing your best to avoid me\\r\\nI\\'m starting to think one day I\\'ll tell the story of us\\r\\nOf how I was losing my mind when I saw you here\\r\\nBut you held your pride like you should have held me\\r\\nOh, I\\'m scared to see the ending\\r\\nWhy are we pretending this is nothing?\\r\\nI\\'d tell you I miss you, but I don\\'t know how\\r\\nI\\'ve never heard silence quite this loud\\r\\nNow I\\'m standing alone in a crowded room\\r\\nAnd we\\'re not speaking\\r\\nAnd I\\'m dying to know\\r\\nIs it killing you like it\\'s killing me?\\r\\nYeah, and I don\\'t know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down\\r\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\\r\\nThis is looking like a contest\\r\\nOf who can act like they care less\\r\\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side\\r\\nThe battle\\'s in your hands now\\r\\nBut I would lay my armor down\\r\\nIf you say you\\'d rather love than fight\\r\\nSo many things that you wish I knew\\r\\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\\r\\nNow I\\'m standing alone in a crowded room\\r\\nAnd we\\'re not speaking\\r\\nAnd I\\'m dying to know\\r\\nIs it killing you like it\\'s killing me?\\r\\nYeah, and I don\\'t know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down\\r\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now\\r\\nAnd we\\'re not speaking\\r\\nAnd I\\'m dying to know is it killing you like it\\'s killing me?\\r\\nYeah\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know what to say since a twist of fate, because we\\'re going down\\r\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\\r\\nThe End\\r\\nYour little hand\\'s wrapped around my finger\\r\\nAnd it\\'s so quiet in the world tonight\\r\\nYour little eyelids flutter cause you\\'re dreaming\\r\\nSo I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light\\r\\nTo you everything\\'s funny, you got nothing to regret\\r\\nI\\'d give all I have, honey\\r\\nIf you could stay like that\\r\\nOh darling, don\\'t you ever grow up\\r\\nDon\\'t you ever grow up, just stay this little\\r\\nOh darling, don\\'t you ever grow up\\r\\nDon\\'t you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\\r\\nI won\\'t let nobody hurt you, won\\'t let no one break your heart\\r\\nAnd no one will desert you\\r\\nJust try to never grow up, never grow up\\r\\nYou\\'re in the car on the way to the movies\\r\\nAnd you\\'re mortified your mom\\'s dropping you off\\r\\nAt 14 there\\'s just so much you can\\'t do\\r\\nAnd you can\\'t wait to move out someday and call your own shots\\r\\nBut don\\'t make her drop you off around the block\\r\\nRemember that she\\'s getting older too\\r\\nAnd don\\'t lose the way that you dance around in your pj\\'s getting ready for school\\r\\nOh darling, don\\'t you ever grow up\\r\\nDon\\'t you ever grow up, just stay this little\\r\\nOh darling, don\\'t you ever grow up\\r\\nDon\\'t you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\\r\\nNo one\\'s ever burned you, nothing\\'s ever left you scarred\\r\\nAnd even though you want to, just try to never grow up\\r\\nTake pictures in your mind of your childhood room\\r\\nMemorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home\\r\\nRemember the footsteps, remember the words said\\r\\nAnd all your little brother\\'s favorite songs\\r\\nI just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone\\r\\nSo here I am in my new apartment\\r\\nIn a big city, they just dropped me off\\r\\nIt\\'s so much colder that I thought it would be\\r\\nSo I tuck myself in and turn my night light on\\r\\nWish I\\'d never grown up\\r\\nI wish I\\'d never grown up\\r\\nOh I don\\'t wanna grow up, wish I\\'d never grown up\\r\\nI could still be little\\r\\nOh I don\\'t wanna grow up, wish I\\'d never grown up\\r\\nIt could still be simple\\r\\nOh darling, don\\'t you ever grow up\\r\\nDon\\'t you ever grow up, just stay this little\\r\\nOh darling, don\\'t you ever grow up\\r\\nDon\\'t you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\\r\\nWon\\'t let nobody hurt you\\r\\nWon\\'t let no one break your heart\\r\\nAnd even though you want to, please try to never grow up\\r\\nOh, don\\'t you ever grow up\\r\\nOh, never grow up, just never grow up\\r\\nThere I was again tonight\\r\\nForcing laughter, faking smiles\\r\\nSame old tired, lonely place\\r\\nWalls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy\\r\\nVanished when I saw your face\\r\\nAll I can say is\\r\\nIt was enchanting to meet you\\r\\nYour eyes whispered \"have we met?\"\\r\\nAcross the room your silhouette\\r\\nStarts to make its way to me\\r\\nThe playful conversation starts\\r\\nCounter all your quick remarks\\r\\nLike passing notes in secrecy\\r\\nAnd it was\\r\\nEnchanting to meet you\\r\\nAll I can say is\\r\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\r\\nThis night is sparkling\\r\\nDon\\'t you let it go\\r\\nI\\'m wonderstruck\\r\\nBlushing all the way home\\r\\nI\\'ll spend forever\\r\\nWondering if you knew\\r\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\r\\nThe lingering question kept me up\\r\\n2AM, who do you love?\\r\\nI wonder \\'til I\\'m wide awake\\r\\nAnd now I\\'m pacing back and forth\\r\\nWishing you were at my door\\r\\nI\\'d open up and you would say \"hey\"\\r\\nIt was\\r\\nEnchanting to meet you\\r\\nAll I know is I was\\r\\nEnchanted to meet you\\r\\nThis night is sparkling\\r\\nDon\\'t you let it go\\r\\nI\\'m wonderstruck\\r\\nBlushing all the way home\\r\\nI\\'ll spend forever\\r\\nWondering if you knew\\r\\nThis night is flawless\\r\\nDon\\'t you let it go\\r\\nI\\'m wonderstruck\\r\\nDancing around all alone\\r\\nI\\'ll spend forever\\r\\nWondering if you knew\\r\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\r\\nThis is me praying that\\r\\nThis was the very first page\\r\\nNot where the storyline ends\\r\\nMy thoughts will echo your name\\r\\nUntil I see you again\\r\\nThese are the words I held back\\r\\nAs I was leaving too soon\\r\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\r\\nPlease don\\'t be in love\\r\\nWith someone else\\r\\nPlease don\\'t have somebody\\r\\nWaiting on you\\r\\nPlease don\\'t be in love\\r\\nWith someone else\\r\\nPlease don\\'t have somebody\\r\\nWaiting on you\\r\\nThis night is sparkling\\r\\nDon\\'t you let it

don\\'t have somebody\\r\\nWaiting on you\\r\\nNow go stand in the corner and think about what you did\\r\\nHa, time for a little revenge\\r\\nThe story starts when it was hot and it was summer and\\r\\nI had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him\\r\\nShe came along, got him alone, and let\\'s hear the applause\\r\\nShe took him faster than you can say sabotage\\r\\nI never saw it coming, wouldn\\'t have suspected it\\r\\nI underestimated just who I was dealing with\\r\\nShe had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum\\r\\nShe underestimated just who she was stealing from\\r\\nShe\\'s not a saint and she\\'s not what you think\\r\\nShe\\'s an actress, whoa\\r\\nShe\\'s better known for the things that she does\\r\\nOn the mattress, whoa\\r\\nSoon she\\'s gonna find stealing other people\\'s toys\\r\\nOn the playground won\\'t make you many friends\\r\\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\\r\\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!\\r\\nShe looks at life like it\\'s a party and she\\'s on the list\\r\\nShe looks at me like I\\'m a trend and she\\'s so over it\\r\\nI think her ever-present frown is a little troubling\\r\\nAnd she thinks I\\'m psycho \\'cause I like to rhyme her name with things\\r\\nBut sophistication isn\\'t what you wear or who you know\\r\\nOr pushing people down to get you where you wanna go\\r\\nOh, they didn\\'t teach you that in prep school, so it\\'s up to me\\r\\nBut no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity\\r\\nShe\\'s not a saint and she\\'s not what you think\\r\\nShe\\'s an actress, whoa\\r\\nShe\\'s better known for the things that she does\\r\\nOn the mattress, whoa\\r\\nSoon she\\'s gonna find stealing other people\\'s toys\\r\\nOn the playground won\\'t make you many friends\\r\\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\\r\\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!\\r\\nI\\'m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey\\r\\nYou might have him, but haven\\'t you heard?\\r\\nI\\'m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey\\r\\nYou might have him, but I always get the last word\\r\\nWhoa, whoa-ah-oh\\r\\nShe\\'s not a saint and she\\'s not what you think\\r\\nShe\\'s an actress, whoa\\r\\nShe\\'s better known for the things that she does\\r\\nOn the mattress, whoa\\r\\nSoon she\\'s gonna find stealing other people\\'s toys\\r\\nOn the playground won\\'t make you many friends\\r\\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\\r\\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!\\r\\nDo you still feel like you know what you\\'re doing?\\r\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t think you do, oh\\r\\nDo you still feel like you know what you\\'re doing?\\r\\nI don\\'t think you do, I don\\'t think you do\\r\\nLet\\'s hear the applause\\r\\nCome on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)\\r\\nSee you deserve some applause\\r\\n\\'Cause you\\'re so much better\\r\\nShe took him faster than you could say sabotage\\r\\nI guess you really did it this time\\r\\nLeft yourself in your warpath\\r\\nLost your balance on a tightrope\\r\\nLost your mind trying to get it back\\r\\nWasn\\'t it easier in your lunchbox days?\\r\\nAlways a bigger bed to crawl into\\r\\nWasn\\'t it beautiful when you believed in everything\\r\\nAnd everybody believed in you?\\r\\nIt\\'s alright, just wait and see\\r\\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\\r\\nOh, who you are is not where you\\'ve been\\r\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\r\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\r\\nDid some things you can\\'t speak of\\r\\nBut at night you live it all again\\r\\nYou wouldn\\'t be shattered on the floor now\\r\\nIf only you had seen what you know now then\\r\\nWasn\\'t it easier in your firefly-catching days?\\r\\nWhen everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you\\r\\nWasn\\'t it beautiful running wild \\'til you fell asleep\\r\\nBefore the monsters caught up to you?\\r\\nIt\\'s alright, just wait and see\\r\\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\\r\\nOhwho you are is not where you\\'ve been\\r\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\r\\nIt\\'s okay, life is a tough crowd\\r\\n32, and still growing up now\\r\\nWho you are is not what you did\\r\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\r\\nTime turns flames to embers\\r\\nYou\\'ll have new Septembers\\r\\nEvery one of us has messed up too\\r\\nLives change like the weather\\r\\nI hope you remember\\r\\nToday is never too late to be brand new\\r\\nIt\\'s alright, just wait and see\\r\\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\\r\\nOh, who you are is not where you\\'ve been\\r\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\r\\nIt\\'s okay, life is a tough crowd\\r\\n32, and still growing up now\\r\\nWho you are is not what you did\\r\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\r\\nYou\\'re still an innocent\\r\\nLost your balance on a tightrope\\r\\nIt\\'s never too late to get it back\\r\\nYou and I walk a fragile line\\r\\nI have known it all this time\\r\\nBut I never thought I\\'d live to see it break\\r\\nIt\\'s getting dark and it\\'s all too quiet\\r\\nAnd I can\\'t trust anything now\\r\\nAnd it\\'s coming over you like it\\'s all a big mistake\\r\\nWhoa, holding my breath\\r\\nWon\\'t lose you again\\r\\nSomething\\'s made your eyes go cold\\r\\nC\\'mon, c\\'mon, don\\'t leave me like this\\r\\nI thought I had you figured out\\r\\nSomething\\'s gone terribly wrong\\r\\nYou\\'re all I wanted\\r\\nC\\'mon, c\\'mon, don\\'t leave me like this\\r\\nI thought I had you figured out\\r\\nCan\\'t breathe whenever you\\'re gone\\r\\nCan\\'t turn back now I\\'m haunted\\r\\nStood there and watched you walk away\\r\\nFrom everything we had\\r\\nBut I still mean every word I said to you\\r\\nHe will try to take away my pain\\r\\nAnd he just might make me smile\\r\\nBut the whole time I\\'m wishing it was you instead\\r\\nOh, holding my breath\\r\\nWon\\'t see you again\\r\\nSomething keeps me holding onto nothing\\r\\nC\\'mon, c\\'mon, don\\'t leave me like this\\r\\nI thought I had you figured out\\r\\nSomething\\'s gone terribly wrong\\r\\nYou\\'re all I wanted\\r\\nC\\'mon, c\\'mon, don\\'t leave me like this\\r\\nI thought I had you figured out\\r\\nCan\\'t breathe whenever you\\'re gone\\r\\nCan\\'t turn back now I\\'m haunted\\r\\nI know\\r\\nI know\\r\\nI just know\\r\\nYou\\'re not gone, you can\\'t be gone, no\\r\\nC\\'mon, c\\'mon, don\\'t leave me like this\\r\\nI thought I had you figured out\\r\\nSomething\\'s gone terribly wrong\\r\\nWon\\'t finish what you started\\r\\nC\\'mon, c\\'mon, don\\'t leave me like this\\r\\nI thought I had you figured out\\r\\nCan\\'t breathe whenever you\\'re gone\\r\\nCan\\'t turn back now I\\'m haunted\\r\\n(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)\\r\\nYou and I walk a fragile line\\r\\nI have known it all this time\\r\\nNever ever thought I\\'d see it break\\r\\nNever thought I\\'d see it\\r\\nI still remember the look on your face\\r\\nLit through the darkness at 1:58\\r\\nThe words that you whispered\\r\\nFor just us to know\\r\\nYou told me you loved me\\r\\nSo why did you go away?\\r\\nAway\\r\\nI do recall now the smell of the rain\\r\\nFresh on the pavement\\r\\nI ran off the plane\\r\\nThat July 9th\\r\\nThe beat of your heart\\r\\nIt jumps through your shirt\\r\\nI can still feel your arms\\r\\nBut now I\\'ll go sit on the floor\\r\\nWearing your clothes\\r\\nAll that I know is\\r\\nI don\\'t know how to be something you miss\\r\\nI never thought we\\'d have a last kiss\\r\\nNever imagined we\\'d end like this\\r\\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\\r\\nI do remember the swing of your step\\r\\nThe life of the party, you\\'re showing off again\\r\\nAnd I roll my eyes and then\\r\\nYou pull me in\\r\\nI\\'m not much for dancing\\r\\nBut for you I did\\r\\nBecause I love your handshake, meeting my father\\r\\nI love how you walk with your hands in your pockets\\r\\nHow you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something\\r\\nThere\\'s not a day I don\\'t miss those rude interruptions\\r\\nBut now I\\'ll go sit on the floor\\r\\nWearing your clothes\\r\\nAll that I know is\\r\\nI don\\'t know how to be something you miss\\r\\nI never thought we\\'d have a last kiss\\r\\nNever imagined we\\'d end like this\\r\\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\\r\\nSo I\\'ll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep\\r\\nAnd I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe\\r\\nAnd I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are\\r\\nHope it\\'s nice where you are\\r\\nAnd I hope the sun shines\\r\\nAnd it\\'s a beautiful day\\r\\nAnd something reminds you\\r\\nYou wish you had stayed\\r\\nYou can plan for a change in weather and time\\r\\nBut I never planned on you changing your mind\\r\\nSo I\\'ll go sit on the floor\\r\\nWearing your clothes\\r\\nAll that I know is\\r\\nI don\\'t know how to be something you miss\\r\\nI never thought we\\'d have a last kiss\\r\\nNever imagined we\\'d end like this\\r\\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\\r\\nJust like our last kiss\\r\\nForever the name on my lips\\r\\nForever the name on my lips\\r\\nJust like our last\\r\\nI said remember this moment, in the back of my mind\\r\\nThe time we stood with our shaking hands\\r\\nThe crowds in the stands went wild\\r\\nWe were the Kings and the Queens\\r\\nAnd they read off our names\\r\\nThe night you danced like you knew our lives\\r\\nWould never be the same\\r\\nYou held your head like a hero\\r\\nOn a history book page\\r\\nIt was the end of a decade\\r\\nBut the start of an age\\r\\nLong live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\\r\\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nOne day, we will be remembered\\r\\nI said remember this feeling\\r\\nI passed the pictures around\\r\\nOf all the years that we stood there\\r\\nOn the side-lines wishing for right now\\r\\nWe are the Kings and the Queens\\r\\nYou traded your baseball cap for a crown\\r\\nWhen they gave us our trophies\\r\\nAnd we held them up for our town\\r\\nAnd the cynics were outraged\\r\\nScreaming \"this is absurd\"\\r\\nCause for a moment a band of thieves\\r\\nIn ripped up jeans got to rule the world\\r\\nLong live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\\r\\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nI\\'m not afraid\\r\\nLong live all the mountains we moved\\r\\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\\r\\nI was screaming long live that look on your face\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nOne day, we will be remembered\\r\\nHold on to spinning around\\r\\nConfetti falls to the ground\\r\\nMay these memories break our fall\\r\\nWill you take a moment?\\r\\nPromise me this\\r\\nThat you\\'ll stand by me forever\\r\\nBut if God forbid fate should step in\\r\\nAnd force us into a goodbye\\r\\nIf you have children some day\\r\\nWhen they point to the pictures\\r\\nPlease tell them my name\\r\\nTell them how the crowds went wild\\r\\nTell them how I hope they shine\\r\\nLong live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nI had the time of my life, with you\\r\\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\\r\\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nI\\'m not afraid\\r\\nSinging, long live all the mountains we moved\\r\\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\\r\\nAnd long, long live that look on your face\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nOne day, we will be remembered\\r\\nElevator buttons and morning air\\r\\nStrangers\\' silence makes me want to take the stairs\\r\\nIf you were here we\\'d laugh about their vacant stares\\r\\nBut right now my time is theirs\\r\\nSeems like there\\'s always someone who disapproves\\r\\nThey\\'ll judge it like they know about me and you\\r\\nAnd the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do\\r\\nThe jury\\'s out, but my choice is you\\r\\nSo don\\'t you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nAnd life makes love look hard\\r\\nThe stakes are high, the water\\'s rough\\r\\nBut this love is ours\\r\\nYou never know what people have up their sleeves\\r\\nGhosts from your past gonna jump out at me\\r\\nLurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles\\r\\nBut I don\\'t care \\'cause right now you\\'re mine\\r\\nAnd you\\'ll say\\r\\nDon\\'t you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nAnd life makes love look hard\\r\\nThe stakes are high, the water\\'s rough\\r\\nBut this love is ours\\r\\nAnd it\\'s not theirs to speculate if it\\'s wrong\\r\\nAnd your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll fight their doubt and give you faith\\r\\nWith this song for you\\r\\n\\'Cause I love the gap between your teeth\\r\\nAnd I love the riddles that you speak\\r\\nAnd any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored\\r\\n\\'Cause my heart is yours\\r\\nSo don\\'t you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nAnd life makes love look hard\\r\\nDon\\'t you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nBut they can\\'t take what\\'s ours\\r\\nThey can\\'t take what\\'s ours\\r\\nThe stakes are high, the water\\'s rough\\r\\nBut this love is ours\\r\\nLast night I heard my own heart beating\\r\\nSounded like footsteps on my stairs\\r\\nSix months gone and I\\'m still reaching\\r\\nEven though I know you\\'re not there\\r\\nI was playing back a thousand memories, baby\\r\\nThinkin\\' \\'bout everything we\\'ve been through\\r\\nMaybe I\\'ve been going back too much lately\\r\\nWhen time stood still and I had you\\r\\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\\r\\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\\r\\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\\r\\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\\r\\nYou could, you could if you just said you\\'re sorry\\r\\nI know that we could work it out somehow\\r\\nBut if this was a movie you\\'d be here by now\\r\\nI know people change and these things happen\\r\\nBut I remember how it was back then\\r\\nWrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing\\r\\nCause nothing like this ever happened to them\\r\\nNow I\\'m pacing down the hall, chasing down your street\\r\\nFlashback to the night when you said to me\\r\\n\"Nothing\\'s gonna change, not for me and you\"\\r\\nNot before I knew how much I had to lose\\r\\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\\r\\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\\r\\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\\r\\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\\r\\nYou could, you could if you just said you\\'re sorry\\r\\nI know that we could work it out somehow\\r\\nBut if this was a movie you\\'d be here by now\\r\\nIf you\\'re out there, if you\\'re somewhere, if you\\'re moving on\\r\\nI\\'ve been waiting for you ever since you\\'ve been gone\\r\\nI just want it back the way it was before\\r\\nAnd I just want to see you back at my front door\\r\\nAnd I say \"Come back, come back, come back to me like\\r\\nYou would before you said it\\'s not that easy\\r\\nBefore the fight, before I locked you out\"\\r\\nBut I take it all back now\\r\\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\\r\\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\\r\\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\\r\\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\\r\\nYou could, you could if you just said you\\'re sorry\\r\\nI know that we could work it out somehow\\r\\nBut if this was a movie you\\'d be here by now\\r\\nYou\\'d be here by now\\r\\nIt\\'s not the kind of ending you want to see now\\r\\nBaby, what about the ending?\\r\\nOh, I thought you\\'d be here by now\\r\\nThought you\\'d be here by now\\r\\nTall, dark, and superman\\r\\nHe puts papers in his briefcase and drives away\\r\\nTo save the world or go to work\\r\\nIt\\'s the same thing to me\\r\\nHe\\'s got his mother\\'s eyes, his father\\'s ambition\\r\\nI wonder if he knows how much that I miss him\\r\\nI hang on every word you say, yay\\r\\nAnd you smile and say, \"How are you?”\\r\\nI say, \"Just fine\"\\r\\nI always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you forever\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nYou\\'ve got a busy day today\\r\\nGo save the world, I\\'ll be around\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nCome back I\\'ll be with you someday\\r\\nI\\'ll be right here on the ground\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nTall, dark and beautiful\\r\\nHe\\'s complicated, he\\'s irrational\\r\\nBut I hope someday you\\'ll take me away and save the day, yeah\\r\\nSomething in his deep brown eyes has me sayin\\'\\r\\nHe\\'s not all bad like his reputation\\r\\nAnd I can\\'t hear one single word they say\\r\\nAnd you\\'ll leave, got places to be and I\\'ll be OK\\r\\nI always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nYou\\'ve got a busy day today\\r\\nGo save the world, I\\'ll be around\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nCome back I\\'ll be with you someday\\r\\nI\\'ll be right here on the ground\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nAnd I watch you fly around the world\\r\\nAnd I hope you don\\'t save some other girl\\r\\nDon\\'t forget, don\\'t forget about me\\r\\nI\\'m far away but I never let you go\\r\\nI\\'m love-struck and looking out the window\\r\\nDon\\'t forget, don\\'t forget where I\\'ll be\\r\\nRight here wishing the flowers were from you\\r\\nWishing the card was from you\\r\\nWishing the call was from you\\r\\n\\'Cause I loved you from the very first day\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nYou\\'ve got a busy day today\\r\\nGo save the world, I\\'ll be around\\r\\nForever and ever here\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nI swear I\\'ll be with you someday\\r\\nI\\'ll be right here on the ground\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\\r\\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nI\\'m walking fast through the traffic lights\\r\\nBusy streets and busy lives\\r\\nAnd all we know is touch and go\\r\\nWe are alone with our changing minds\\r\\nWe fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll never be the same\\r\\nYou come around and the armor falls\\r\\nPierce the room like a cannon ball\\r\\nNow all we know, is don\\'t let go\\r\\nWe are alone just you and me\\r\\nUp in your room and our slates are clean\\r\\nJust twin fire signs, four blue eyes\\r\\nSo you were never a saint\\r\\nAnd I\\'ve loved in shades of wrong\\r\\nWe learn to live with the pain\\r\\nMosaic broken hearts\\r\\nBut this love is brave and wild\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll never be the same\\r\\nThis is a state of grace\\r\\nThis is the worthwhile fight\\r\\nLove is a ruthless game\\r\\nUnless you play it good and right\\r\\nThese are the hands of fate\\r\\nYou\\'re my Achilles heel\\r\\nThis is the golden age of something good\\r\\nAnd right and real\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll never be the same\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll never be the same\\r\\nThis is a state of grace\\r\\nThis is a worthwhile fight\\r\\nLove is a ruthless game\\r\\nUnless you play it good and right\\r\\nLoving him is like driving a new Maserati\\r\\nDown a dead-end street\\r\\nFaster than the wind, passionate as sin\\r\\nEnding so suddenly\\r\\nLoving him is like trying to change your mind\\r\\nOnce you\\'re already flying through the free fall\\r\\nLike the colors in autumn, so bright\\r\\nJust before they lose it all\\r\\nLosing him was blue like I\\'d never known\\r\\nMissing him was dark grey, all alone\\r\\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\\r\\nBut loving him was red\\r\\nTouching him was like realizing all you ever wanted\\r\\nWas right there in front of you\\r\\nMemorizing him was as easy as knowing\\r\\nAll the words to your old favorite song\\r\\nFighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword\\r\\nAnd realizing there\\'s no right answer\\r\\nRegretting him was like wishing you never found out\\r\\nThat love could be that strong\\r\\nLosing him was blue like I\\'d never known\\r\\nMissing him was dark grey, all alone\\r\\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\\r\\nBut loving him was red\\r\\nRemembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes\\r\\nTell myself it\\'s time now, gotta let go\\r\\nBut moving on from him is impossible\\r\\nWhen I still see it all in my head\\r\\nIn burning red\\r\\nLoving him was red\\r\\nLosing him was blue like I\\'d never known\\r\\nMissing him was dark grey, all alone\\r\\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\\r\\nBut loving him was red\\r\\nAnd that\\'s why he\\'s spinning \\'round in my head\\r\\nComes back to me, burning red\\r\\nYeah, yeah\\r\\nHis love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street\\r\\nPut your lips close to mine\\r\\nAs long as they don\\'t touch\\r\\nOut of focus, eye to eye\\r\\nTill the gravity\\'s too much\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll do anything you say\\r\\nIf you say it with your hands\\r\\nAnd I\\'d be smart to walk away\\r\\nBut you\\'re quick sand\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nThis path is reckless\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd I I I like it\\r\\nI can\\'t decide if it\\'s a choice\\r\\nGetting swept away\\r\\nI hear the sound of my own voice\\r\\nAsking you to stay\\r\\nAnd all we are is skin and bone trained to get along\\r\\nForever going with the flow but you\\'re friction\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nThis path is reckless\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd I I I like it\\r\\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\\r\\nAnd I will get you get you alone\\r\\nYour name has echoed through my mind\\r\\nAnd I just think you should think you should know\\r\\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive\\r\\nAnd I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home\\r\\nThis hope is treacherous\\r\\nThis daydream is dangerous\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I\\r\\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\\r\\nAnd I will get you get you alone\\r\\nYour name has echoed through my mind\\r\\nAnd I just think you should think you should know\\r\\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive\\r\\nAnd I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home\\r\\nThis hope is treacherous\\r\\nThis daydream is dangerous\\r\\nThis hope is treacherous\\r\\nI-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I ...\\r\\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\\r\\nAnd I will get you get you alone\\r\\nYour name has echoed through my mind\\r\\nAnd I just think you should think you should know\\r\\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive\\r\\nAnd I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home\\r\\nI\\'ll follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd I-I-I like it\\r\\nOnce upon a time, a few mistakes ago\\r\\nI was in your sights, you got me alone\\r\\nYou found me, you found me, you found me\\r\\nI guess you didn\\'t care, and I guess I liked that\\r\\nAnd when I fell hard, you took a step back\\r\\nWithout me, without me, without me\\r\\nAnd he\\'s long gone, when he\\'s next to me\\r\\nAnd I realize the blame is on me\\r\\n\\'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places I\\'d never been\\r\\nTill you put me down, oh\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places I\\'d never been\\r\\nNow I\\'m lying on the cold hard ground\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\\r\\nNo apologies, he\\'ll never see you cry\\r\\nPretends he doesn\\'t know that he\\'s the reason why\\r\\nYou\\'re drowning, you\\'re drowning\\r\\nYou\\'re drowning\\r\\nAnd I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street\\r\\nA new notch in your belt is all I\\'ll ever be\\r\\nAnd now I see, now I see\\r\\nNow I see\\r\\nHe was long gone when he met me\\r\\nAnd I realize the joke is on me, hey!\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places I\\'d never been\\r\\nTill you put me down, oh\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places I\\'d never been\\r\\nNow I\\'m lying on the cold hard ground\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\\r\\nAnd the saddest fear, comes creeping in\\r\\nThat you never loved me\\r\\nOr her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places I\\'d never been\\r\\nTill you put me down, oh\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places I\\'d never been\\r\\nNow I\\'m lying on the cold hard ground\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\\r\\nOh, oh\\r\\nTrouble, trouble, trouble\\r\\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\\r\\nBut something \\'bout it felt like home somehow and I\\r\\nLeft my scarf there at your sister\\'s house\\r\\nAnd you\\'ve still got it in your drawer, even now\\r\\nOh, your sweet disposition\\r\\nAnd my wide-eyed gaze\\r\\nWe\\'re singing in a car getting lost Upstate\\r\\nThe autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\\r\\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\\r\\nAnd I know it\\'s long gone, and that magic\\'s not here no more\\r\\nAnd I might be okay, but I\\'m not fine at all\\r\\n\\'Cause there we are again on that little town street\\r\\nYou almost ran the red \\'cause you were looking over at me\\r\\nWind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well\\r\\nPhoto album on the counter\\r\\nYour cheeks were turning red\\r\\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\\r\\nAnd your mother\\'s telling stories \\'bout you on the tee ball team\\r\\nYou taught me about your past thinking your future was me\\r\\nAnd I know it\\'s long gone, and there was nothing else I could do\\r\\nAnd I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to\\r\\n\\'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\\r\\nWe\\'re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\\r\\nDown the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah\\r\\nAnd maybe we got lost in translation\\r\\nMaybe I asked for too much\\r\\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\\r\\n\\'Till you tore it all up\\r\\nRunning scared, I was there, I remember it all too well\\r\\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\\r\\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\\r\\nI\\'m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\\r\\n\\'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well\\r\\nTime won\\'t fly it\\'s like I\\'m paralyzed by it\\r\\nI\\'d like to be my old self again\\r\\nBut I\\'m still trying to find it\\r\\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\\r\\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\\r\\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\\r\\n\\'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\\r\\nYou can\\'t get rid of it, \\'cause you remember it all too well, yeah\\r\\nBecause there we are again when I loved you so\\r\\nBack before you lost the one real thing you\\'ve ever known\\r\\nIt was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well\\r\\nWind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all\\r\\nDown the stairs, you were there, you remember it all\\r\\nIt was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well\\r\\nIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters\\r\\nAnd make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh\\r\\nIt feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight\\r\\nTo fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh\\r\\nYeah\\r\\nWe\\'re happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time\\r\\nIt\\'s miserable and magical, oh yeah\\r\\nTonight\\'s the night when we forget about the deadlines\\r\\nIt\\'s time, uh uh\\r\\nI don\\'t know about you, but I\\'m feeling 22\\r\\nEverything will be alright if you keep me next to you\\r\\nYou don\\'t know about me, but I bet you wanted to\\r\\nEverything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we\\'re 22\\r\\n22\\r\\nIt seems like one of those nights\\r\\nThis place is too crowded, too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh\\r\\n(Who\\'s Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)\\r\\nIt seems like one of those nights\\r\\nWe ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming\\r\\nInstead of sleeping\\r\\nYeah\\r\\nWe\\'re happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way\\r\\nIt\\'s miserable and magical, oh yeah\\r\\nTonight\\'s the night when we forget about\\r\\nThe heartbreaks, it\\'s time\\r\\nOh oh\\r\\nI don\\'t know about you, but I\\'m feeling 22\\r\\nEverything will be alright if you keep me next to you\\r\\nYou don\\'t know about me, but I bet you wanted to\\r\\nEverything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we\\'re 22\\r\\n22\\r\\nI don\\'t know about you\\r\\n22, 22\\r\\nIt feels like one of those nights\\r\\nWe ditch the whole scene\\r\\nIt feels like one of those nights\\r\\nWe won\\'t be sleeping\\r\\nIt feels like one of those nights\\r\\nYou look like bad news, I gotta have you\\r\\nI gotta have you\\r\\nI don\\'t know about you, but I\\'m feeling 22\\r\\nEverything will be alright if you keep me next to you\\r\\nYou don\\'t know about me, but I bet you wanted to\\r\\nEverything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we\\'re 22\\r\\n22\\r\\nDancing like 22, yeah, 22, yeah yeah\\r\\nIt feels like one of those nights\\r\\nWe ditch the whole scene\\r\\nIt feels like one of those nights\\r\\nWe won\\'t be sleeping\\r\\nIt feels like one of those nights\\r\\nYou look like bad news, I gotta have you\\r\\nI gotta have you\\r\\nI bet this time of night you\\'re still up\\r\\nI bet you\\'re tired from a long hard week\\r\\nI bet you\\'re sitting in your chair by the window\\r\\nLooking out at the city\\r\\nAnd I bet sometimes you wonder about me\\r\\nAnd I just want to tell you\\r\\nIt takes everything in me not to call you\\r\\nAnd I wish I could run to you\\r\\nAnd I hope you know that\\r\\nEverytime I don\\'t\\r\\nI almost do, I almost do\\r\\nI bet you think I either moved on or hate you\\r\\n‘Cause each time you reach out there\\'s no reply\\r\\nI bet it never, ever occurred to you that I can\\'t say hello to you\\r\\nAnd risk another goodbye\\r\\nAnd I just want to tell you\\r\\nIt takes everything in me not to call you\\r\\nAnd I wish I could run to you\\r\\nAnd I hope you know that\\r\\nEverytime I don\\'t\\r\\nI almost do, I almost do\\r\\nOh, we made quite a mess, babe\\r\\nIt\\'s probably better off this way\\r\\nAnd I confess, baby\\r\\nIn my dreams you\\'re touching my face\\r\\nAnd asking me if I\\'d want to try again with you\\r\\nAnd I almost do\\r\\nAnd I just want to tell you\\r\\nIt takes everything in me not to call you\\r\\nAnd I wish I could run to you\\r\\nAnd I hope you know that\\r\\nEverytime I don\\'t\\r\\nI almost do, I almost do\\r\\nI bet this time of night you\\'re still up\\r\\nI bet you\\'re tired from a long hard week\\r\\nI bet you\\'re sittin\\' in your chair by the window\\r\\nLooking out at the city\\r\\nAnd I hope sometimes you wonder about me\\r\\nI remember when we broke up, the first time\\r\\nSaying, \"This is it, I\\'ve had enough\" \\'cause, like\\r\\nWe hadn\\'t seen each other in a month\\r\\nWhen you said you needed space – what<U+203D>\\r\\nThen you come around again and say\\r\\n\"Baby, I miss you and I swear I\\'m gonna change; trust me\"\\r\\nRemember how that lasted for a day?\\r\\nI say, \"I hate you,\" we break up, you call me, \"I love you\"\\r\\nOoh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh\\r\\nWe called it off again last night but\\r\\nOoh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh\\r\\nThis time, I\\'m telling you, I\\'m telling you\\r\\nWe are never, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nWe are never, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\\r\\nBut we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nLike, ever\\r\\nI\\'m really gonna miss you picking fights and me\\r\\nFalling for it screaming that I\\'m right and you\\r\\nWould hide away and find your peace of mind\\r\\nWith some indie record that\\'s much cooler than mine\\r\\nOoh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh\\r\\nWe called it off again last night but\\r\\nOoh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh\\r\\nThis time, I\\'m telling you, I\\'m telling you\\r\\nWe are never, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nWe are never, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\\r\\nBut we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nOoh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh (yeah!)\\r\\nOoh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh (yeah!)\\r\\nOoh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh (yeah!)\\r\\nOh—oh—oh!\\r\\nI used to think that we were forever, ever\\r\\nAnd I used to say, \"Never say never\"\\r\\nHuh, so he calls me up and he\\'s like, \"I still love you\"\\r\\nAnd I\\'m like, \"I just— I mean, this is exhausting, you know?\\r\\nLike, we are never getting back together, like, ever\"\\r\\nWe are never, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nWe are never, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\\r\\nBut we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nWe— (ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh, ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh)\\r\\n—getting back together\\r\\nWe— (ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh, ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh)\\r\\n—getting back together\\r\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)\\r\\nBut we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\\r\\nI\\'m pretty sure we almost broke up last night\\r\\nI threw my phone across the room, at you\\r\\nI was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stay\\r\\nThis morning I said we should talk about it\\r\\n\\'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved\\r\\nThat\\'s when you came in wearing a football helmet\\r\\nAnd said okay let\\'s talk\\r\\nAnd I said\\r\\nStay, stay, stay\\r\\nI\\'ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time\\r\\nYou think that it\\'s funny when I\\'m mad, mad, mad\\r\\nBut I think that it\\'s best if we both stay\\r\\nBefore you I\\'d only dated self-indulgent takers\\r\\nWho took all of their problems out on me\\r\\nBut you carry my groceries and now I\\'m always laughing\\r\\nAnd I love you because you have given me no choice but to\\r\\nStay, stay, stay\\r\\nI\\'ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time\\r\\nYou think that it\\'s funny when I\\'m mad, mad, mad\\r\\nBut I think that it\\'s best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay\\r\\nYou took the time to memorize me, my fears, my hopes and dreams\\r\\nI just like hanging out with you, all the time\\r\\nAll those times that you didn\\'t leave it\\'s been occurring to me\\r\\nI\\'d like to hang out with you, for my whole life\\r\\nStay, and I\\'ll be loving you for quite some time\\r\\nNo one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad\\r\\nSo I think that it\\'s best if we both stay, stay\\r\\nStay, stay, stay, stay!\\r\\nStay, stay, stay\\r\\nI\\'ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time\\r\\nYou think that it\\'s funny when I\\'m mad, mad, mad\\r\\nBut I think that it\\'s best if we both stay, stay\\r\\nStay, stay, stay, stay!\\r\\nStay, stay, stay\\r\\nI\\'ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time\\r\\nYou think that it\\'s funny when I\\'m mad, mad, mad\\r\\nBut I think that it\\'s best if we both stay\\r\\n(ha-haha-eee, It\\'s so fun)\\r\\nFind myself at your door\\r\\nJust like all those times before\\r\\nI\\'m not sure how I got there\\r\\nAll roads they lead me here\\r\\nI imagine you are home\\r\\nIn your room, all alone\\r\\nAnd you open your eyes into mine\\r\\nAnd everything feels better\\r\\nAnd right before your eyes\\r\\nI\\'m breaking\\r\\nNo fuss, no reasons why\\r\\nJust you and me\\r\\n(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\nPut my name at the top of your list\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you why\\r\\nYou break my heart in the blink of an eye\\r\\n(eye, eye)\\r\\nYou find yourself at my door\\r\\nJust like all those times before\\r\\nYou wear your best apology\\r\\nBut I was there to watch you leave\\r\\nAnd all the times I let you in\\r\\nJust for you to go again\\r\\nDisappear when you come back\\r\\nEverything is better\\r\\nAnd right before your eyes\\r\\nI\\'m aching\\r\\nNo fuss, nowhere to hide\\r\\nJust you and me\\r\\n(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\nPut my name at the top of your list\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you why\\r\\nYou break my heart in the blink of an eye\\r\\n(eye, eye)\\r\\nGary Lightbody\\r\\nThis is the last time you tell me I\\'ve got it wrong\\r\\nThis is the last time I say it\\'s been you all along\\r\\nThis is the last time I let you in my door\\r\\nThis is the last time, I won\\'t hurt you anymore\\r\\nOh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho\\r\\nOh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\nPut my name at the top of your list\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you why\\r\\nYou break my heart in the blink of an eye\\r\\nGary Lightbody\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\n(This is the last time I\\'m asking you this)\\r\\nPut my name at the top of your list\\r\\n(Put my name at the top of your list)\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you why\\r\\n(This is the last time I\\'m asking you why)\\r\\nYou break my heart in the blink of an eye\\r\\n(You break my heart)\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you, last time I\\'m asking you\\r\\nLast time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you, last time I\\'m asking you\\r\\nLast time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you, last time I\\'m asking you\\r\\nLast time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\nThis is the last time I\\'m asking you, last time I\\'m asking you\\r\\nLast time I\\'m asking you this\\r\\nI was reminiscing just the other day\\r\\nWhile having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away\\r\\nBack to a first-glance feeling on New York time\\r\\nBack when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme\\r\\nTook off faster than a green light, go\\r\\nHey, you skip the conversation when you already know\\r\\nI left a note on the door with a joke we\\'d made\\r\\nAnd that was the first day\\r\\nAnd darling, it was good never looking down\\r\\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground\\r\\nSpinning like a girl in a brand new dress\\r\\nWe had this big wide city all to ourselves\\r\\nWe blocked the noise with the sound of \\'I need you\\'\\r\\nAnd for the first time I had something to lose\\r\\nAnd I guess we fell apart in the usual way\\r\\nAnd the story\\'s got dust on every page\\r\\nBut sometimes I wonder how you think about it now\\r\\nAnd I see your face in every crowd\\r\\n\\'Cause darling, it was good never looking down\\r\\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground\\r\\nTonight I\\'m gonna dance for all that we\\'ve been through\\r\\nBut I don\\'t wanna dance if I\\'m not dancing with you\\r\\nTonight I\\'m gonna dance like you were in this room\\r\\nBut I don\\'t wanna dance if I\\'m not dancing with you\\r\\nIt was good never looking down\\r\\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground\\r\\nTonight I\\'m gonna dance for all that we\\'ve been through\\r\\nBut I don\\'t wanna dance if I\\'m not dancing with you\\r\\nTonight I\\'m gonna dance like you were in this room\\r\\nBut I don\\'t wanna dance if I\\'m not dancing with you\\r\\nLong handwritten note, deep in your pocket\\r\\nWords, how little they mean, when you\\'re a little too late\\r\\nI stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket\\r\\nGood girls, hopeful they\\'ll be and long they will wait\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nIn dreams, I meet you in warm conversation\\r\\nWe both wake in lonely beds, different cities\\r\\nAnd time is taking its sweet time erasing you\\r\\nAnd you\\'ve got your demons and darling they all look like me\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nDistance, timing, breakdown, fighting\\r\\nSilence, the train runs off its tracks\\r\\nKiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?\\r\\nHang up, give up, and for the life of us we can\\'t get back\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nNew to town with a made up name\\r\\nIn the angel city, chasing fortune and fame\\r\\nAnd the camera flashes, make it look like a dream\\r\\nYou had it figured out since you were in school\\r\\nEverybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool\\r\\nSo overnight you look like a sixties\\' queen\\r\\nAnother name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky\\r\\nAnd they\\'ll tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nYeah, they\\'ll tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nBut can you tell me now, you\\'re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh\\r\\nNow it\\'s big black cars, and Riviera views\\r\\nAnd your lover in the foyer doesn\\'t even know you\\r\\nAnd your secrets end up splashed on the news front page\\r\\nAnd they tell you that you\\'re lucky\\r\\nBut you\\'re so confused\\r\\nCause you don\\'t feel pretty, you just feel used\\r\\nAnd all the young things line up to take your place\\r\\nAnother name goes up in lights\\r\\nYou wonder if you\\'ll make it out alive\\r\\nAnd they\\'ll tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nYeah, they\\'ll tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nBut can you tell me now, you\\'re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh\\r\\nIt was a few years later, I showed up here\\r\\nAnd they still tell the legend of how you disappeared\\r\\nHow you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out\\r\\nThey say you bought a bunch of land somewhere\\r\\nChose a rose garden over Madison Square\\r\\nAnd it took some time, but I understand it now\\r\\n‘Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right\\r\\nLet me tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nLet me tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nLet me tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh\\r\\nAnd they\\'ll tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nYeah, they\\'ll tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one\\r\\nAnd they\\'ll tell you now, you\\'re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh\\r\\nOh, whoa, oh, oh\\r\\nAll I knew this morning when I woke\\r\\nIs I know something now, know something now I didn\\'t before\\r\\nAnd all I\\'ve seen since 18 hours ago is green eyes and freckles and your smile\\r\\nIn the back of my mind making me feel like\\r\\nI just want to know you better\\r\\nKnow you better, know you better now\\r\\nI just want to know you better\\r\\nKnow you better, know you better now\\r\\nI just want to know you better\\r\\nKnow you better, know you better now\\r\\nI just want to know you, know you, know you\\r\\n\\'Cause all I know is we said hello\\r\\nAnd your eyes look like coming home\\r\\nAll I know is a simple name, everything has changed\\r\\nAll I know is you held the door\\r\\nYou\\'ll be mine and I\\'ll be yours\\r\\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed\\r\\nTaylor Swift\\r\\nAnd all my walls stood tall painted blue\\r\\nAnd I\\'ll take them down\\r\\nTake them down and open up the door for you\\r\\nAnd all I feel in my stomach is butterflies\\r\\nThe beautiful kind, making up for lost time\\r\\nTaking flight, making me feel like\\r\\nI just want to know you better\\r\\nKnow you better, know you better now\\r\\nI just want to know you better\\r\\nKnow you better, know you better now\\r\\nI just want to know you better\\r\\nKnow you better, know you better now\\r\\nI just want to know you, know you, know you\\r\\n\\'Cause all I know is we said hello\\r\\nAnd your eyes look like coming home\\r\\nAll I know is a simple name, everything has changed\\r\\nAll I know is you held the door\\r\\nYou\\'ll be mine and I\\'ll be yours\\r\\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed\\r\\nCome back and tell me why\\r\\nI\\'m feeling like i\\'ve missed you all this time\\r\\nAnd meet me there tonight\\r\\nAnd let me know that it\\'s not all in my mind\\r\\nI just want to know you better\\r\\nKnow you better, know you better now\\r\\nI just want to know you, know you, know you\\r\\n\\'Cause all I know is we said hello\\r\\nAnd your eyes look lIke coming home\\r\\nAll I know is a simple name, everything has changed\\r\\nAll I know is you held the door\\r\\nYou\\'ll be mine and I\\'ll be yours\\r\\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed\\r\\nAll I know is we said hello\\r\\nSo dust off your highest hopes\\r\\nAll I know is pouring rain\\r\\nAnd everything has changed\\r\\nAll I know is a new found grace\\r\\nAll my days, I\\'ll know your face\\r\\nAll I know since yesterday is everything has changed\\r\\nI said, \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune\"\\r\\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight\\r\\nI met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of \\'45\\r\\nPicked me up, late one night at the window\\r\\nWe were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild\\r\\nCan\\'t remember what song it was playing when we walked in\\r\\nThe night we snuck into a yacht club party\\r\\nPretending to be a duchess and a prince\\r\\nAnd I said, \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune\"\\r\\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight, starlight\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight, starlight\\r\\nHe said, \"Look at you worrying too much about things you can\\'t change\\r\\nYou\\'ll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way\"\\r\\nHe was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you see the starlight, starlight?\\r\\nDon\\'t you dream impossible things?\"\\r\\nLike, \"Oh my, what a marvelous tune\"\\r\\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight, starlight\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight, starlight\\r\\nOoh, ooh, he\\'s talking crazy\\r\\nOoh, ooh, dancing with me\\r\\nOoh, ooh, we could get married\\r\\nHave ten kids and teach \\'em how to dream\\r\\nOh my, what a marvelous tune\\r\\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight, starlight\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight, starlight\\r\\nLike we\\'re made of starlight, starlight\\r\\nLike we dream impossible dreams\\r\\nLike starlight, starlight\\r\\nLike we dream impossible dreams\\r\\nDon\\'t you see the starlight, starlight?\\r\\nDon\\'t you dream impossible things?\\r\\nTook a deep breath in the mirror\\r\\nHe didn\\'t like it when I wore high heels\\r\\nBut I do\\r\\nTurn the lock and put my headphones on\\r\\nHe always said he didn\\'t get this song but I do, I do\\r\\nWalked in expecting you\\'d be late\\r\\nBut you got here early and you stand and wave\\r\\nI walk to you\\r\\nYou pull my chair out and help me in\\r\\nAnd you don\\'t know how nice that is but I do\\r\\nAnd you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\\r\\nI think it\\'s strange that you think I\\'m funny \\'cause he never did\\r\\nI\\'ve been spending the last eight months\\r\\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again\\r\\nYou said you never met one girl who\\r\\nHad as many James Taylor records as you\\r\\nBut I do\\r\\nWe tell stories and you don\\'t know why I\\'m coming off a little shy\\r\\nBut I do\\r\\nAnd you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\\r\\nI think it\\'s strange that you think I\\'m funny \\'cause he never did\\r\\nI\\'ve been spending the last eight months\\r\\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again\\r\\nAnd we walked down the block, to my car\\r\\nAnd I almost brought him up\\r\\nBut you start to talk about the movies\\r\\nThat your family watches every single Christmas\\r\\nAnd I want to talk about that\\r\\nAnd for the first time what\\'s past is past\\r\\n\\'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\\r\\nI think it\\'s strange that you think I\\'m funny \\'cause he never did\\r\\nI\\'ve been spending the last eight months\\r\\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again\\r\\nYou should\\'ve been there\\r\\nShould\\'ve burst through the door\\r\\nWith that \\'baby I\\'m right here\\' smile\\r\\nAnd it would\\'ve felt like\\r\\nA million little shining stars had just aligned\\r\\nAnd I would\\'ve been so happy\\r\\nChristmas lights glisten\\r\\nI\\'ve got my eye on the door\\r\\nJust waiting for you to walk in\\r\\nBut the time is ticking\\r\\nPeople ask me how I\\'ve been\\r\\nAs I comb back through my memory\\r\\nHow you said you\\'d be here\\r\\nYou said you\\'d be here\\r\\nAnd it was like slow motion\\r\\nStanding there in my party dress\\r\\nIn red lipstick\\r\\nWith no one to impress\\r\\nAnd they\\'re all laughing\\r\\nAs I\\'m looking around the room\\r\\nBut there was one thing missing\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nAnd the hours pass by\\r\\nNow I just wanna be alone\\r\\nBut your close friends always seem to know\\r\\nWhen there\\'s something really wrong\\r\\nSo they follow me down the hall\\r\\nAnd there in the bathroom\\r\\nI try not to fall apart\\r\\nAnd the sinking feeling starts\\r\\nAs I say hopelessly\\r\\n\"He said he\\'d be here\"\\r\\nAnd it was like slow motion\\r\\nStanding there in my party dress\\r\\nIn red lipstick\\r\\nWith no one to impress\\r\\nAnd they\\'re all laughing\\r\\nAnd asking me about you\\r\\nBut there was one thing missing\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nWhat do you say\\r\\nWhen tears are streaming down your face\\r\\nIn front of everyone you know?\\r\\nAnd what do you do when the one\\r\\nWho means the most to you\\r\\nIs the one who didn\\'t show?\\r\\nYou should\\'ve been here\\r\\nAnd I would\\'ve been so happy\\r\\nAnd it was like slow motion\\r\\nStanding there in my party dress\\r\\nIn red lipstick\\r\\nWith no one to impress\\r\\nAnd they\\'re all standing around me singing\\r\\n\"Happy birthday to you\"\\r\\nBut there was one thing missing\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\r\\nI knew\\r\\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\r\\nYou call me later\\r\\nAnd said, \"I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t make it\"\\r\\nAnd I said, \"I\\'m sorry too\"\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nYou said it in a simple way\\r\\n4 AM, the second day\\r\\nHow strange that I don\\'t know you at all\\r\\nStumbled through the long goodbye\\r\\nOne last kiss, then catch your flight\\r\\nRight when I was just about to fall\\r\\nI told myself don\\'t get attached\\r\\nBut in my mind I play it back\\r\\nSpinning faster than the plane that took you\\r\\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in\\r\\nI don\\'t wanna miss you like this\\r\\nCome back be here, come back be here\\r\\nI guess you\\'re in New York today\\r\\nI don\\'t wanna need you this way\\r\\nCome back be here, come back be here\\r\\nThe delicate beginning rush\\r\\nThe feeling you can know so much\\r\\nWithout knowing anything at all\\r\\nAnd now that I can put this down\\r\\nIf I had known what I\\'d known now\\r\\nI never would have played so nonchalant\\r\\nTaxi cabs and busy streets\\r\\nThat never bring you back to me\\r\\nI can\\'t help but wish you took me with you\\r\\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in\\r\\nI don\\'t wanna miss you like this\\r\\nCome back be here, come back be here\\r\\nI guess you\\'re in London today\\r\\nI don\\'t wanna need you this way\\r\\nCome back be here, come back be here\\r\\nThis is falling in love in the cruelest way\\r\\nThis is falling for you and you are worlds away\\r\\nNew York be here\\r\\nBut you\\'re in London and I break down\\r\\nCause it\\'s not fair that you\\'re not around\\r\\nI don\\'t wanna miss you like this\\r\\nCome back be here\\r\\nCome back be here\\r\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nI don\\'t even know her\\r\\nBut I feel a responsibility to do what\\'s upstanding and right\\r\\nIt\\'s kinda like a code, yeah\\r\\nAnd you\\'ve been getting closer and closer\\r\\nAnd crossing so many lines\\r\\nAnd it would be a fine proposition\\r\\nIf I was a stupid girl\\r\\nBut honey I am no one\\'s exception\\r\\nThis I have previously learned\\r\\nSo don\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nI see you turn off your phone\\r\\nNow you\\'ve got me alone, and I say\\r\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nI just want to make sure\\r\\nYou understand perfectly you\\'re the kind of man who makes me sad\\r\\nWhile she waits up, you chase down the newest thing\\r\\nAnd take for granted what you have\\r\\nAnd it would be a fine proposition\\r\\nIf I was a stupid girl\\r\\nAnd yeah, I might go with it\\r\\nIf I hadn\\'t once been just like her\\r\\nSo don\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nI see you turn off your phone\\r\\nNow you\\'ve got me alone, and I say\\r\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nCall a cab, lose my number\\r\\nYou\\'re about to lose your girl\\r\\nCall a cab, lose my number\\r\\nLet\\'s consider this lesson learned\\r\\nWant to see you pick up your phone\\r\\nAnd tell her you\\'re coming home\\r\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\r\\nIt would be a fine proposition\\r\\nIf I hadn\\'t once been just like her\\r\\nWalking through a crowd, the village is aglow\\r\\nKaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats\\r\\nEverybody here wanted something more\\r\\nSearching for a sound we hadn\\'t heard before\\r\\nAnd it said\\r\\nWelcome to New York!\\r\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York!\\r\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nIt\\'s a new soundtrack\\r\\nI could dance to this beat (beat)\\r\\nForevermore\\r\\nThe lights are so

floors\\r\\nTook our broken hearts, put them in a drawer\\r\\nEverybody here was someone else before\\r\\nAnd you can want who you want\\r\\nBoys and boys and girls and girls\\r\\nWelcome to New York!\\r\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York!\\r\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New

waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nLike any great love, it keeps you guessing\\r\\nLike any real love, it\\'s ever-changing\\r\\nLike any true love, it drives you crazy\\r\\nBut you know you wouldn\\'t change anything, anything, anything\\r\\nWelcome to New York!\\r\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York!\\r\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nIt\\'s a new soundtrack\\r\\nI could dance to this beat (beat)\\r\\nForevermore\\r\\nThe lights are so bright\\r\\nBut they never blind me (me)\\r\\nWelcome to New York!\\r\\nIt\\'s been waiting for you\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nWelcome to New York\\r\\nNice to meet you, where you been?\\r\\nI could show you incredible things\\r\\nMagic, madness, heaven, sin\\r\\nSaw you there, and I thought\\r\\n\"Oh my God, look at that face\\r\\nYou look like my next mistake\\r\\nLove\\'s a game, wanna

Rumors fly\\r\\nAnd I know you heard about me\\r\\nSo hey, let\\'s be friends\\r\\nI\\'m dyin\\' to see how this one ends\\r\\nGrab your passport and my hand\\r\\nI can make the bad guys good for a

you and I\"\\r\\nI said \"I\\'ve been there too a few times\"\\r\\nCause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\\r\\nAnd I got that red lip classic thing that you like\\r\\nAnd when we go crashing down, we come back every time\\r\\nCause we never go out of style, we never go out of style\\r\\nYou got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt\\r\\nAnd I got that good girl faith and a

everytime\\r\\nCause we never go out of style, we never go out of style\\r\\nLooking at it now\\r\\nIt all seems so simple\\r\\nWe were lying on your couch\\r\\nI remember\\r\\nYou took a Polaroid of us\\r\\nThen discovered (then discovered)\\r\\nThe rest of the world was black and white\\r\\nBut we were in screaming color\\r\\nAnd I remember thinking…\\r\\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?\\r\\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\\r\\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\\r\\nAre we in the clear yet? In the clear yet?
