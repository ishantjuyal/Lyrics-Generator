# Word-Prediction

Developed a Word Prediction Model using LSTM. I have trained the model on Taylor Swift's Lyrics so the model could be used as a lyrics generator. You just need to provide some root words and it will predict next words to generate lyrics. 

## Dataset
The dataset was a txt file which cotained the lyrics of all the songs. 
I have added several other txt files too, if you want to train the model on those and generate different models. 

## Performance
